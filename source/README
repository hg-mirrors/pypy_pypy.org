You generate this website by using yatiblog from here:

http://github.com/tav/ampify/blob/master/environ/startup/yatiblog

by running 

yatiblog <path to website dir> you'll get a website subdirectory which
contains all necessary stuff to upload and deploy.

Other required dependencies (argh):
    * "genshi" from http://genshi.edgewall.org/
    * "pygments" from "easy_install pygments"
    * "yaml" from ... (I give up at that point, as this doesn't compile)

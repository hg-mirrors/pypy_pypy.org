You can get necessary software by doing:

	pip install yatiblog

(tested with version 1.0) you can do:

    yatiblog -o ..

you'll get html output in the parent directory. you need an account
Then you can check it in, login to pypy@pypy.org 
and go to pypy.org/htdocs/ and type "hg pull -u".

(Note: nowadays I think there is a script that automatically does
"hg pull -u" every half hour, so logging in is not needed.)

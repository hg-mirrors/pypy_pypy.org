  There are `nightly binary builds`_ available. Those builds are not always
  as stable as the release, but they contain numerous bugfixes and 
  performance improvements.

Here are the binaries of the current release — **PyPy 2.0 beta1** — (`what's
new in PyPy 2.0 beta1?`_) for x86 Linux, Mac OS/X, Windows or ARM linux.

You can also find here the older 1.9 release.

.. _`Default (with a JIT Compiler)`:

"JIT Compiler" version
-------------------------------

These binaries include a Just-in-Time compiler.  They only work on
x86 CPUs that have the SSE2_ instruction set (most of
them do, nowadays), or on x86-64 CPUs. They also contain `stackless`_
extensions, like `greenlets`_.
(This is the official release 2.0 beta1 and 1.9;
for the most up-to-date version see below.)

If your CPU is really old, it may not have SSE2.  In this case, you need
to translate_ yourself with the option ``--jit-backend=x86-without-sse2``.

.. _`Other versions (without a JIT)`:

Other versions
-------------------------------

The other versions of PyPy are:

* The most up-to-date `nightly build`_ with a JIT, if the official
  release is too old for what you want to do. If the nightly build does
  not work for you, you might have more luck using `alternative nightly build`_,
  however linux binary distribution is hard.

* No JIT: A version without the JIT.  Consumes a bit less memory
  and may be faster on short-running scripts.  (Note that a similar
  effect can be obtained by running ``pypy --jit off``.)

* Sandboxing: A special safe version.  Read the docs about sandboxing_.
  (It is also possible to translate_ a version that includes both
  sandboxing and the JIT compiler, although as the JIT is relatively
  complicated, this reduces a bit the level of confidence we can put in
  the result.) **Note that the sandboxed binary needs a full pypy checkout
  to work**. Consult the `sandbox docs`_ for details

  * `Linux binary (64bit)`__

  * `Linux binary (32bit)`__

.. __: https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/downloads/pypy-1.8-sandbox-linux.tar.bz2
.. _`sandbox docs`: http://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/sandbox.html

These versions are not officially part of the releases, which focuses
on the JIT.  You can find prebuilt binaries for them on our
`nightly build`_, or translate_ them yourself.

Installing
-------------------------------

All binary versions are packaged in a ``tar.bz2`` or ``zip`` file.  When
uncompressed, they run in-place.  For now you can uncompress them
either somewhere in your home directory or, say, in ``/opt``, and
if you want, put a symlink from somewhere like
``/usr/local/bin/pypy`` to ``/path/to/pypy-2.0/bin/pypy``.  Do
not move or copy the executable ``pypy`` outside the tree --- put
a symlink to it, otherwise it will not find its libraries.


.. _translate:

Building from source
-------------------------------

1. Get the source code.  The following packages contain the source at
   the same revision as the above binaries:

   * `pypy-2.0b1-src.tar.bz2`__ (sources, Unix line endings)
   * `pypy-2.0b1-src.zip`__ (sources, Unix line endings too, sorry)

   .. __: https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/get/release-2.0-beta-1.tar.bz2
   .. __: https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/get/release-2.0-beta-1.zip

   Or you can checkout the current trunk using Mercurial_ (the trunk
   usually works and is of course more up-to-date)::

     hg clone https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy

2. Make sure you **installed the dependencies.**  See the list here__.

   .. __: http://pypy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/getting-started-python.html#translating-the-pypy-python-interpreter

3. Enter the ``goal`` directory::

     cd pypy/pypy/translator/goal      # release 2.0-beta-1
     cd pypy/pypy/goal                 # current trunk

4. Run the ``translate.py`` script (called ``rpython.py`` in the current
   trunk).  Here are the common combinations
   of options (works also with ``python`` instead of ``pypy``)::

     pypy translate.py -Ojit                # get the JIT version
     pypy translate.py -O2                  # get the no-jit version
     pypy translate.py -O2 --sandbox        # get the sandbox version
     pypy translate.py -Ojit --backend=cli  # only for branch/cli-jit

   Or with the current trunk::
    
     ../../rpython/bin/rpython -Ojit        # or -O2, etc.

5. Enjoy Mandelbrot ``:-)``  It takes on the order of half an hour to
   finish the translation, and 2.x GB of RAM on a 32-bit system
   and 4.x GB on 64-bit systems.  (Do not start a translation on a
   machine with insufficient RAM!  It will just swap forever.  See
   notes below in that case.)

Notes:

* It is recommended to use PyPy to do translations, instead of using CPython,
  because it is twice as fast.  You should just start by downloading an
  official release of PyPy (with the JIT).  If you really have to use CPython
  then note that we are talking about CPython 2.5-2.7 here, not CPython 3.x.

* If RAM usage is a problem (or if you are on Windows, because win32's limit
  is 2 GB unless you hack a lot), then you can (for now) tweak some parameters
  via environment variables and command-line options.  The following command
  takes a bit more time, but finishes with only using 3.0 GB of RAM (on
  Linux 64-bit; probably not much more than 1.6 GB on 32-bit).  It should be
  noted that it is less than with CPython. ::

    PYPY_GC_MAX_DELTA=200MB pypy --jit loop_longevity=300 ./translate.py -Ojit

* Because of ``asmgcroot``, compiling the generated C files containing the JIT
  is delicate.  It requires using either MSVC or gcc with no particularly
  fancy options.  It does not work e.g. with clang, or if you pass uncommon
  options with the ``CFLAGS`` environment variable.  You can also try to
  compile PyPy with the `shadow stack`_ option.

Packaging
---------

Once PyPy is translated from source the binary package similar to those provided in the section `Default (with a JIT Compiler)`_ above could be easily created with ``package.py`` script as following::

    cd ./pypy/pypy/tool/release/
    python package.py ../../.. pypy-my-own-package-name

Here are the various binaries of **PyPy 1.2** that we provide for x86 Linux,
Mac OS/X or Windows. This is the first release of PyPy containing JIT, hence
the main goal is to try this out and see how it works for you. We put
a lot of effort into making JIT a stable piece of software and we don't
observe crashes, however, please consider it a beta version to try things out.

.. _`With a JIT Compiler`:

"JIT Compiler" version
-------------------------------

These binaries include a Just-in-Time compiler.  They only work on
**32-bit** `x86 (IA-32)`_ CPUs that have the SSE2_ instruction set (most of
them do, nowadays), as well as on any `x86-64`_ machine in the 32-bit
compatibility mode.

* `Linux binary`__
* `Mac OS/X binary`__
* `Windows binary`__

.. __: http://pypy.org/download/pypy-1.2-osx.tar.bz2
.. __: http://pypy.org/download/pypy-1.2-win32.zip

If your CPU is really old, it may not have SSE2.  In this case, you need
to translate_ yourself with the option ``--jit-backend=x86-without-sse2``.

If your CPU is a 64-bit machine and you want to translate_ a 32-bit
version of PyPy yourself, `here are hints`_.

If you want to help us with implementing the 64-bit JIT backend,
`contact us`_!


.. _`With no JIT Compiler`:
.. _`no jit version.`:

"No JIT" version
-------------------------------

**WARNING!** Unless you really want to try this out, we recommend the JIT
version.

This version still has a few advantages over the JIT Compiler version.
Notably, for Python programs that require large amounts of memory (at
least a few hundred MBs), the following version of ``pypy-nojit`` runs them
by requiring generally 1.5x or 2x less memory than CPython.  These
binaries work on 32-bit `x86 (IA-32)`_ CPUs as well as `x86-64`_ CPUs
in the 32-bit compatibility mode.

* `Linux binary`__
* `Mac OS/X binary`__
* `Windows binary`__

.. __: http://pypy.org/download/pypy-1.2-linux-nojit.tar.bz2
.. __: http://pypy.org/download/pypy-1.2-osx-nojit.tar.bz2
.. __: http://pypy.org/download/pypy-1.2-win32-nojit.zip

If your CPU is a 64-bit machine and you want to translate_ a 32-bit
version of PyPy yourself, `here are hints`_.

If you want to help us with finishing the implementation of the native
64-bit version (there are a few known issues, like missing code in
`ctypes`_ to implement calls to C functions), `contact us`_.  In general
this version will more or less translate_ anywhere.


.. _`Sandboxed version`:

"Sandbox" version
-------------------------------

A special safe version.  Read the docs about sandboxing_.  These
binaries work on 32-bit `x86 (IA-32)`_ CPUs as well as `x86-64`_ CPUs
in the 32-bit compatibility mode.

* `Linux binary`__
* `Mac OS/X binary`__
* `Windows binary`__

.. __: http://pypy.org/download/pypy-1.2-linux-sandbox.bz2
.. __: http://pypy.org/download/pypy-1.2-osx-sandbox.bz2
.. __: http://pypy.org/download/pypy-1.2-win32-sandbox.zip

It is also possible to translate_ a version that includes both
sandboxing and the JIT compiler, although as the JIT is relatively
complicated, this reduce a bit the level of confidence we can put in it.

If your CPU is a 64-bit machine and you want to translate_ a 32-bit
version of PyPy yourself, `here are hints`_.

The native 64-bit version needs testing and careful reviewing;
`contact us`_!


.. _`Stackless version`:

"Stackless" version
-------------------------------

Provides Stackless_ extensions, as well as greenlets_.  These
binaries work on 32-bit `x86 (IA-32)`_ CPUs as well as `x86-64`_ CPUs
in the 32-bit compatibility mode.

* `Linux binary`__
* `Mac OS/X binary`__
* `Windows binary`__

.. __: http://pypy.org/download/pypy-1.2-linux-stackless.tar.bz2
.. __: http://pypy.org/download/pypy-1.2-osx-stackless.tar.bz2
.. __: http://pypy.org/download/pypy-1.2-win32-stackless.zip

It is not possible right now to combine Stackless features with the JIT.

If your CPU is a 64-bit machine and you want to translate_ a 32-bit
version of PyPy yourself, `here are hints`_.

For the native 64-bit version, see the issues of the `no jit version.`_.


Installing
-------------------------------

All versions are packaged in a ``tar.bz2`` or ``zip`` file.  When
uncompressed, they run in-place.  On Linux or Mac OS/X, they can also be
installed by manually moving the files::

    /usr/bin/pypy     # or pypy-nojit etc.
    /usr/share/pypy-1.2/lib-python/*
    /usr/share/pypy-1.2/pypy/*

You can also install it to ``/usr/local/bin`` and ``/usr/local/share``.


.. _translate:

Building from source
-------------------------------

1. Get the source code.  The following packages contain the source at
   the same revision as the above binaries (these are svn exports):

   * `pypy-1.2-src.tar.bz2`__ (sources, Unix line endings)
   * `pypy-1.2-src.zip`__ (sources, Windows line endings)

   .. __: http://pypy.org/download/pypy-1.2-src.tar.bz2
   .. __: http://pypy.org/download/pypy-1.2-src.zip

   Or you can checkout the current trunk using Subversion_ (the trunk
   usually works and is of course more up-to-date)::

     svn co http://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/trunk pypy-trunk

   Windows users trying the zip file are expected to use MSVC.
   The trunk version contains fixes to support MinGW32.  More
   information on `our dev site`__.

   .. __: http://codespeak.net/pypy/trunk/pypy/doc/windows.html

2. Enter the ``goal`` directory::

     cd pypy-trunk/pypy/translator/goal

3. Run the ``translate.py`` script.  Here are the common combinations
   of options::

     python translate.py -Ojit                # get the JIT version
     python translate.py -O2                  # get the no-jit version
     python translate.py --sandbox            # get the sandbox version
     python translate.py --stackless          # get the stackless version
     python translate.py -Ojit --backend=cli  # only for branch/cli-jit

4. Enjoy Mandelbrot ``:-)``  It takes on the order of one hour to
   finish the translation, and 1.3 GB of RAM on a 32-bit system.
   (Do not start a translation on a machine with 1GB or less!)


.. _`here are hints`:

Note on building a 32-bit version on 64-bit systems
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To build 32-bit versions of ``pypy-c`` you need to run ``translate.py``
in a 32-bit version of Python.  You can check with::

    $ python
    Python 2.6.2 (...)
    >>> import sys
    >>> sys.maxint

This prints 9223372036854775807 in 64-bit versions and 2147483647 in
32-bit versions.

On Linux, you may have to compile yourself a 32-bit Python, e.g.::

    cd Python-2.6.4
    CC="gcc -m32" LDFLAGS="-L/lib32 -L/usr/lib32 \
      -L`pwd`/lib32 -Wl,-rpath,/lib32 -Wl,-rpath,/usr/lib32" \
      ./configure
    make
    # and then use this ./python to run translate.py

On Mac OS/X: the easiest is to systematically use Python 2.5 when
working with PyPy.  Indeed, the standard Python 2.5 runs in 32-bit mode.

On Windows, the only known way is to install a 32-bit Python
manually.

  There are `nightly binary builds`_ available. Those builds are not always
  as stable as the release, but they contain numerous bugfixes and 
  performance improvements. **Note that the OS X nightly builds
  (but not the release) are slightly
  miscompiled due to buildslave being old. Contributions are welcomed**.

Here are the binaries for the current release — **PyPy 2.1** — (`what's new
in PyPy 2.1?`_) for x86 and ARM Linux, Mac OS/X, Windows and the upcoming release — **PyPy3 2.1 beta1** — (`what's new in
PyPy3 2.1 beta1?`_).

.. _`Default (with a JIT Compiler)`:

"JIT Compiler" version
-------------------------------

These binaries include a Just-in-Time compiler.  They only work on
x86 CPUs that have the SSE2_ instruction set (most of
them do, nowadays), or on x86-64 CPUs. They also contain `stackless`_
extensions, like `greenlets`_.
(This is the official release 2.1;
for the most up-to-date version see below.)

Note that Linux binaries are dynamically linked, as is usual, and thus might
not be usable due to the sad story of linux binary compatibility.  This means
that **Linux binaries are only usable on the distributions written next to
them** unless you're ready to hack your system by adding symlinks to the
libraries it tries to open.  In general, we recommend either building from
source or downloading your PyPy from your release vendor. `Ubuntu`_ (`PPA`_),
`Debian`_, `Homebrew`_, MacPorts,
`Fedora`_, `Gentoo`_ and `Arch`_ are known to package PyPy, with various
degrees of being up-to-date. If you feel
like trying a more statically linked binary (which we do not recommend using
in production due to potential future security issues), you can find the
older `32bit Linux`_ and `64bit Linux`_ at an earlier time of release 2.0.

If your CPU is really old, it may not have SSE2.  In this case, you need
to translate_ yourself with the option ``--jit-backend=x86-without-sse2``.

``[1]:`` stating it again: the Linux binaries are provided for the
distributions listed here.  **If your distribution is not exactly this
one, it won't work,** likely: ``pypy: error while loading shared
libraries: ...``.  You need to hack a lot --- or you need to translate_
your own version from source --- or you need to wait until your
distribution adds a package, see above --- or you can try the statically
linked versions listed above.


.. _`Other versions (without a JIT)`:

Other versions
-------------------------------

The other versions of PyPy are:

* The most up-to-date `nightly build`_ with a JIT, if the official
  release is too old for what you want to do. There are versions for
  different libc on this site too.

* Sandboxing: A special safe version.  Read the docs about sandboxing_.
  (It is also possible to translate_ a version that includes both
  sandboxing and the JIT compiler, although as the JIT is relatively
  complicated, this reduces a bit the level of confidence we can put in
  the result.) **Note that the sandboxed binary needs a full pypy checkout
  to work**. Consult the `sandbox docs`_ for details. (These are old,
  PyPy 1.8.)

  * `Linux binary (64bit)`__

  * `Linux binary (32bit)`__

.. _`sandbox docs`: http://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/sandbox.html

.. _`nightly build`: http://buildbot.pypy.org/nightly/trunk/

Installing
-------------------------------

All binary versions are packaged in a ``tar.bz2`` or ``zip`` file.  When
uncompressed, they run in-place.  For now you can uncompress them
either somewhere in your home directory or, say, in ``/opt``, and
if you want, put a symlink from somewhere like
``/usr/local/bin/pypy`` to ``/path/to/pypy-2.1/bin/pypy``.  Do
not move or copy the executable ``pypy`` outside the tree --- put
a symlink to it, otherwise it will not find its libraries.


.. _translate:

Building from source
-------------------------------

1. Get the source code.  The following packages contain the source at
   the same revision as the above binaries:

   * `pypy-2.1-src.tar.bz2`__ (sources, Unix line endings)
   * `pypy-2.1-src.zip`__ (sources, Unix line endings too, sorry)

   .. __: https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/downloads/pypy-2.1-src.tar.bz2
   .. __: https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/downloads/pypy-2.1-src.zip

   Or you can checkout the current trunk using Mercurial_ (the trunk
   usually works and is of course more up-to-date)::

     hg clone https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy

2. Make sure you **installed the dependencies.**  See the list here__.

   .. __: http://pypy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/getting-started-python.html#translating-the-pypy-python-interpreter

3. Enter the ``goal`` directory::

     cd pypy/pypy/goal

4. Run the ``rpython`` script.  Here are the common combinations
   of options (works also with ``python`` instead of ``pypy``)::

     pypy ../../rpython/bin/rpython -Ojit targetpypystandalone           # get the JIT version
     pypy ../../rpython/bin/rpython -O2 targetpypystandalone             # get the no-jit version
     pypy ../../rpython/bin/rpython -O2 --sandbox targetpypystandalone   # get the sandbox version

5. Enjoy Mandelbrot ``:-)``  It takes on the order of half an hour to
   finish the translation, and 2.x GB of RAM on a 32-bit system
   and 4.x GB on 64-bit systems.  (Do not start a translation on a
   machine with insufficient RAM!  It will just swap forever.  See
   notes below in that case.)

Notes:

* It is recommended to use PyPy to do translations, instead of using CPython,
  because it is twice as fast.  You should just start by downloading an
  official release of PyPy (with the JIT).  If you really have to use CPython
  then note that we are talking about CPython 2.5-2.7 here, not CPython 3.x.

* If RAM usage is a problem (or if you are on Windows, because win32's limit
  is 2 GB unless you hack a lot), then you can (for now) tweak some parameters
  via environment variables and command-line options.  The following command
  takes a bit more time, but finishes with only using 3.0 GB of RAM (on
  Linux 64-bit; probably not much more than 1.6 GB on 32-bit).  It should be
  noted that it is less than with CPython. ::

    PYPY_GC_MAX_DELTA=200MB pypy --jit loop_longevity=300 ../../rpython/bin/rpython -Ojit targetpypystandalone

* On Linux, because of ``asmgcroot``, compiling the generated C files
  is delicate.  It requires using gcc with no particularly
  fancy options.  It does not work e.g. with clang, or if you pass uncommon
  options with the ``CFLAGS`` environment variable.  If you insist on
  passing these options or using clang, then you can compile PyPy with
  the `shadow stack`_ option instead (for a small performance price in
  non-JITted code).

Packaging
---------

Once PyPy is translated from source the binary package similar to those provided in the section `Default (with a JIT Compiler)`_ above could be easily created with ``package.py`` script as following::

    cd ./pypy/pypy/tool/release/
    python package.py ../../.. pypy-my-own-package-name

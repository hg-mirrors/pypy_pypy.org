Other features
===========================================================

PyPy has many secondary features and semi-independent
projects.  We will mention here:

* **the .NET backend:** you get a version of ``pypy-c`` that runs
  natively in the .NET/CLI VM.  Of particular interest is `the cli-jit
  branch,`_ in which you can make a version of ``pypy-c`` which also
  contains a high-level JIT compiler (it compiles your Python programs
  Just in Time into CLR bytecodes, which are in turn compiled natively
  by the VM).

* **the Java backend:** PyPy can run on the Java VM, but more
  care is needed to finish this project.  Writing a backend for our
  high-level JIT compiler would be excellent.  `Contact us!`_

* **Other languages:** available in a `separate part of the repository`_,
  we implemented other languages too: Prolog_ (almost complete), as
  well as Smalltalk, JavaScript, Io, Scheme and Gameboy.

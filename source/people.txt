Armin Rigo
==========

Armin Rigo is a researcher at the Heinrich-Heine Universitat
Dusseldorf (Germany).  He studied Mathematics at the University
of Lausanne (Switzerland), obtained his Ph.D. in Logic and Set
Theory at the Free University of Brussels (Belgium) in 2002, and
worked at the University of Southampton (UK) until 2005.  He is
the author of Psyco, the first just-in-time compiler for Python.
He is one of the founders and lead developers of the PyPy project 
which began in 2003.  He has taken part in all areas, from the Python
language definition to the RPython translation framework,
including the garbage collector and the tracing just-in-time
compiler.

Maciej Fija≈Çkowski
==================

Maciej is a freelancer working mostly on PyPy for the past several years.
He's a core developer, working on all kinds of parts in the entire codebase.
Maciej has been going to many conferences, advertising PyPy to a broader
audience for the past several years. He's also the main maintainer of
`jitviewer`_, a tool for analyzing performance of your python programs under
PyPy.

Antonio Cuni loves skiing, mountains and programming languages.  He studied
Computer Science at the University of Genova (Italy), and then at the same
university he obtained his Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2010, with a
dissertation about the PyPy CLI JIT backend.  He has been a core PyPy
developer since 2006, working in various areas including the "object oriented
backends" for the CLI and JVM, the RPython translation framework, the Python
interpreter and the JIT compiler generator.  Apart from PyPy, he is the author of
other popular tools such as ``pdb++``.

Benjamin Peterson
=================

Both a PyPy and CPython core developer, Benjamin knows way too much about the
nooks and cranies of the Python language. He is driven by a fascination with
interpreters and compilers of all shapes and sizes. Around the PyPy project, he
tries to be generally useful and has taken on major projects including rewriting
PyPy's Python compiler and porting PyPy to Python 2.7.

Alex Gaynor
===========

Alex is an undergraduate student of computer science at Rennsealear
Polytechnic Institute in Troy, NY.  He's been a PyPy developer since 2010, and
has worked on many parts of the codebase, including the JIT compiler's
optimizers, the RPython translation toolchain, and the Python interpreter. In
addition to his work on PyPy, Alex is a core developer of Django (a Python web
framework) and CPython, as well as an elected member of the Python Software
Foundation.

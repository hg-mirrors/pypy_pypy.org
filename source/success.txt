PyPy has been successfully used in production by various people. Here are
few excepts of feedback we received:

LWN short experiment
--------------------

LWN has a tool they use for parsing "git log"'s output in order to do analysis
on the contributors to the Linux kernel. Simply by switching to PyPy they were
able to get a 3x speedup, from 63 seconds to 21 seconds, compared to CPython.

"In other ways, PyPy is ready for prime time; it implements the (Python 2.x) language faithfully, and it is fast."

MyHDL
-----

MyHDL got a speed up by 6-12x, on various benchmarks, according to their
`performance page`_, putting it in the same league as other HDL implementations.

"By simply changing the Python interpreter, MyHDL is playing in the same league as Verilog and VHDL simulators. This is a remarkable achievement, given that Python's power stays completely available. There is no reason anymore to avoid MyHDL because of performance concerns."

PyPy has been successfully used in production by various people. Here are
few excepts of feedback we received:

LWN short experiment
--------------------

LWN did `an experiment`_ with parsing "git log" and got a speedup from 63s to
21s using PyPy over CPython.

"In other ways, PyPy is ready for prime time; it implements the (Python 2.x) language faithfully, and it is fast."

MyHDL
-----

MyHDL got speed up by 6-12x according to their `performance page`_, putting
it in the same league as other HDL implementations.

"By simply changing the Python interpreter, MyHDL is playing in the same league as Verilog and VHDL simulators. This is a remarkable achievement, given that Python's power stays completely available. There is no reason anymore to avoid MyHDL because of performance concerns."

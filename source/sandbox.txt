title: Sandboxing
---

PyPy's *sandboxing* is a working prototype for the idea of running untrusted
user programs. Unlike other sandboxing approaches for Python, PyPy's does not
try to limit language features considered "unsafe". Instead we replace all
calls to external libraries (C or platform) with a stub that communicates
with an external process handling the policy.

To run the sandboxed process, get a `sandboxed pypy-c`_ and run::

   pypy_interact.py pypy-c-sandbox

To read more about its features, go to `our dev site`_.

title: Welcome to PyPy

PyPy is a `fast`_, `compliant`_ alternative implementation of the `Python`_
language (2.7.6 and 3.2.5). It has several advantages and distinct features:

  * **Speed:** thanks to its Just-in-Time compiler, Python programs
    often run `faster`_ on PyPy.  `(What is a JIT compiler?)`_

  * **Memory usage:** memory-hungry Python programs (many hundreds of
    MBs and above) might end up taking `less space`_ than they do in CPython.

  * **Compatibility:** PyPy is `highly compatible`_ with existing python code.
    It supports `cffi`_ and can run popular python libraries like `twisted`_
    and `django`_.

  * **Sandboxing:** PyPy provides the ability to `run untrusted code`_ in a
    fully secure way.

  * **Stackless:** PyPy comes by default with support for `stackless mode`_,
    providing micro-threads for massive concurrency.

  * As well as other `features`_.

PyPy

Researching a higly flexible and modular language platform and implementing it by leveraging
the Open Source Python Language and Community

The PyPy project have been an ongoing Open Source Python language implementation since 2003.
In December 2004 PyPy recieved EU-funding within the Framework Programme 6, second call for proposals
("Open development platforms and services" IST).

A consortium of 7 partners in Germany, France and Sweden are working to achieve the goal of a
open run-time environment for the Open Source Programming Language Python. The scientific aspects of the project is 
to investigate novel techniques (based on aspect-oriented programming code generation and abstract interpretation) for the implementation of 
practical dynamic languages.

A methodological goal of the project is also to show case a novel software engineering process, Sprint Driven Development. This is an Agile 
methodology, providing adynamic and adaptive environment, suitable for co-operative and distributed development.

The project is divided into three major phases, phase 1 has the focus of developing the actual research tool - the self contained compiler, 
phase 2 has the focus of optimisations (core, translation and dynamic) and in phase 3 the actual integration of efforts and dissemination of the results.
The project has an expected deadline in November 2006.

PyPy is still, though EU-funded, heavily integrated in the Open Source community of Python.The methodology of choice
is the key strategy to make sure that the community of skilled and enthusiastic developers can contribute in ways that wouldn't have been possible
without EU-funding.

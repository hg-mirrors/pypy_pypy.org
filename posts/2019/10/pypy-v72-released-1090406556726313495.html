The PyPy team is proud to release the version 7.2.0 of PyPy, which includes
two different interpreters:<br>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>PyPy2.7, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 2.7 including the stdlib for CPython 2.7.13</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>PyPy3.6: which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 3.6, including the stdlib for CPython 3.6.9.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>

</div>
</blockquote>
The interpreters are based on much the same codebase, thus the double
release.<br>

<br>
As always, this release is 100% compatible with the previous one and fixed
several issues and bugs raised by the growing community of PyPy users.
We strongly recommend updating. Many of the fixes are the direct result of
end-user bug reports, so please continue reporting issues as they crop up.<br>

<br>
You can download the v7.2 releases here:<br>

With the support of Arm Holdings Ltd. and <a class="reference external" href="https://crossbario.com/">Crossbar.io</a>, this release supports
the 64-bit <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">aarch64</span></code> ARM architecture. More about the work and the
performance data around this welcome development can be found in the <a class="reference external" href="https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2019/07/pypy-jit-for-aarch64.html">blog
post</a>.<br>
<br>

This release removes the “beta” tag from PyPy3.6. While there may still be some
small corner-case incompatibilities (around the exact error messages in
exceptions and the handling of faulty codec errorhandlers) we are happy with
the quality of the 3.6 series and are looking forward to working on a Python
3.7 interpreter.<br>

<br>
We updated our benchmark runner at <a class="reference external" href="https://speed.pypy.org/">https://speed.pypy.org</a> to a more modern
machine and updated the baseline python to CPython 2.7.11. Thanks to <a class="reference external" href="https://baroquesoftware.com/">Baroque
Software</a> for maintaining the benchmark runner.<br>

<br>
The CFFI-based <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">_ssl</span></code> module was backported to PyPy2.7 and updated to use
<a class="reference external" href="https://cryptography.io/en/latest">cryptography</a> version 2.7. Additionally, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">_hashlib</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">crypt</span></code> (or
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">_crypt</span></code> on Python3) modules were converted to CFFI. This has two
consequences: end users and packagers can more easily update these libraries
for their platform by executing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">(cd</span> <span class="pre">lib_pypy;</span> <span class="pre">../bin/pypy</span> <span class="pre">_*_build.py)</span></code>.
More significantly, since PyPy itself links to fewer system shared objects
(DLLs), on platforms with a single runtime namespace like linux, different CFFI
and c-extension modules can load different versions of the same shared object
into PyPy without collision (<a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.com/pypy/pypy/issues/2617">issue 2617</a>).<br>

<br>
Until downstream providers begin to distribute c-extension builds with PyPy, we
have made packages for some common packages <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/antocuni/pypy-wheels">available as wheels</a>.<br>

<br>
The <a class="reference external" href="http://cffi.readthedocs.io/">CFFI</a> backend has been updated to version 1.13.0. We recommend using CFFI
rather than c-extensions to interact with C, and <a class="reference external" href="https://cppyy.readthedocs.io/">cppyy</a> for interacting with
C++ code.<br>

<br>
Thanks to <a class="reference external" href="https://anvil.works/">Anvil</a>, we revived the <a class="reference external" href="https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2019/08">PyPy Sandbox</a>, (soon to be released) which allows total control
over a Python interpreter’s interactions with the external world.<br>

<br>
We implemented a new JSON decoder that is much faster, uses less memory, and
uses a JIT-friendly specialized dictionary. More about that in the recent <a href="https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2019/10/pypys-new-json-parser.html">blog post</a><br>

<br>
We would like to thank our donors for the continued support of the PyPy
project. If PyPy is not quite good enough for your needs, we are available for
direct consulting work.
<br>
We would also like to thank our contributors and encourage new people to join
the project. PyPy has many layers and we need help with all of them: <a class="reference external" href="https://pypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">PyPy</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.org/">RPython</a> documentation improvements, tweaking popular modules to run
on PyPy, or general <a class="reference external" href="https://pypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/project-ideas.html">help</a> with making RPython’s JIT even better. Since the
previous release, we have accepted contributions from 27 new contributors,
so thanks for pitching in.<br>

<span style="font-size: x-large;">What is PyPy?</span></h2>
PyPy is a very compliant Python interpreter, almost a drop-in replacement for
CPython 2.7, 3.6. It’s fast (<a class="reference external" href="http://speed.pypy.org/">PyPy and CPython 2.7.x</a> performance
comparison) due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.<br>

<br>
We also welcome developers of other <a class="reference external" href="http://rpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html">dynamic languages</a> to see what RPython
can do for them.<br>

<br>
This PyPy release supports:<br>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><strong>x86</strong> machines on most common operating systems
(Linux 32/64 bit, Mac OS X 64-bit, Windows 32-bit, OpenBSD, FreeBSD)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-is-pypy">
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>big- and little-endian variants of <strong>PPC64</strong> running Linux<strong> </strong></li>

Unfortunately at the moment of writing our ARM buildbots are out of service,
so for now we are <strong>not</strong> releasing any binary for the ARM architecture (32-bit), although PyPy does support ARM 32-bit processors.<br>

<div class="section" id="changelog">
<h2 style="text-align: center;">
<span style="font-size: x-large;">What else is new?</span></h2>
PyPy 7.1 was released in March, 2019.

<html><body><p>One question about using utf8 text encoding, internally. <br><br>Is text handling code much different now, in PyPy, vs. cPython?<br><br>If handling characters ( code points ) within the ASCII range <br>is more like Python v.2.x, that would be very good news to <br>at least one old fart who is having trouble even treating <br>print as a function ...<br><br>Thanks!<br></p></body></html>

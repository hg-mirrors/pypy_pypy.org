<html><body><p>@Noah The answer is complicated because CPython changed its internals more than once.  The current CPython 3.x stores unicode strings as an array of same-sized characters; if your string contains even one character over 0xffff then it's an array of 4 bytes for all the characters.  Sometimes CPython *also* caches the UTF8 string, but doesn't use it much.  The new PyPy is very different: it uses the UTF8 string *only*, and it works for both PyPy 2.7 or 3.x.</p></body></html>

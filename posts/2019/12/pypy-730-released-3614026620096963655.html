The PyPy team is proud to release the version 7.3.0 of PyPy, which includes
two different interpreters:<br>
<ul class="simple">
<li>PyPy2.7, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 2.7 including the stdlib for CPython 2.7.13</li>
<li>PyPy3.6: which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 3.6, including the stdlib for CPython 3.6.9.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>

The interpreters are based on much the same codebase, thus the double
release.<br>

<br>
We have worked with the python packaging group to support tooling around
building third party packages for python, so this release changes the ABI tag
for PyPy.<br>

<br>
Based on the great work done in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/squeaky-pl/portable-pypy">portable-pypy</a>, the linux downloads we
provide are now built on top of the <a href="https://github.com/pypa/manylinux"><span class="problematic" id="id11">manylinux2010</span></a> CentOS6 docker image.
The tarballs include the needed shared objects to run on any platform that
supports manylinux2010 wheels, which should include all supported versions of
debian- and RedHat-based distributions (including Ubuntu, CentOS, and Fedora).<br>

<br>
The <a class="reference external" href="http://cffi.readthedocs.io/">CFFI</a> backend has been updated to version 1.13.1. We recommend using CFFI
rather than c-extensions to interact with C.<br>

The built-in <a href="https://cppyy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cppyy</span></code></a> module was upgraded to 1.10.6, which
provides, among others, better template resolution, stricter <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">enum</span></code> handling,
anonymous struct/unions, cmake fragments for distribution, optimizations for
PODs, and faster wrapper calls. We reccomend using <a class="reference external" href="https://cppyy.readthedocs.io/">cppyy</a> for performant
wrapping of C++ code for Python.<br>

<br>
The vendored pyrepl package for interaction inside the REPL was updated.<br>

<br>
Support for codepage encoding and decoding was added for Windows.<br>

<br>
As always, this release fixed several issues and bugs raised by the growing
community of PyPy users.  We strongly recommend updating. Many of the fixes are
the direct result of end-user bug reports, so please continue reporting issues
as they crop up.<br>

We would like to thank our donors for the continued support of the PyPy
project. If PyPy is not quite good enough for your needs, we are available for
direct consulting work.<br>

<br>
We would also like to thank our contributors and encourage new people to join
the project. PyPy has many layers and we need help with all of them: <a class="reference external" href="http://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/index.html">PyPy</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.org/">RPython</a> documentation improvements, tweaking popular packages to run
on pypy, or general <a class="reference external" href="http://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/project-ideas.html">help</a> with making RPython’s JIT even better. Since the
previous release, we have accepted contributions from 3 new contributors,
thanks for pitching in.<br>
<br>
If you are a python library maintainer and use c-extensions, please consider making a cffi / cppyy version of your library that would be performant on PyPy. If you are stuck with using the C-API, you can use <a href="https://github.com/pypy/manylinux">docker images with PyPy built in</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/matthew-brett/multibuild/">multibuild system</a> to build wheels.<br>

<span style="font-size: x-large;">What is PyPy?</span></h2>
PyPy is a very compliant Python interpreter, almost a drop-in replacement for
CPython 2.7, 3.6. It’s fast (<a class="reference external" href="http://speed.pypy.org/">PyPy and CPython 2.7.x</a> performance
comparison) due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.<br>
<br>
We also welcome developers of other <a class="reference external" href="http://rpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html">dynamic languages</a> to see what RPython
can do for them.<br>
<br>
This PyPy release supports:<br>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><b>x86</b> machines on most common operating systems
(Linux 32/64 bit, Mac OS X 64-bit, Windows 32-bit, OpenBSD, FreeBSD)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-is-pypy">
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>big- and little-endian variants of <b>PPC64</b> running Linux<b> </b></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-is-pypy">
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><b>s390x</b> running Linux</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-is-pypy">
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>64-bit <b>ARM</b> machines running Linux</li>
</ul>
Unfortunately at the moment of writing our ARM buildbots are out of service,
so for now we are <b>not</b> releasing any binary for the ARM architecture (32-bit), although PyPy does support ARM 32-bit processors.<br>

<div class="section" id="changelog">
<h2 style="text-align: center;">
<span style="font-size: x-large;">What else is new?</span></h2>
PyPy 7.2 was released in October, 2019.
There are many incremental improvements to RPython and PyPy, For more information about the 7.3.0 release, see the full <a href="https://pypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/release-v7.3.0.html">changelog</a>.<br>

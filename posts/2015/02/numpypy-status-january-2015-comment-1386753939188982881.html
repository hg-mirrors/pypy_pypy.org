<html><body><p>Linalg is basically usable with the usual caveats: use PyPy 2.5.0 or later, use pypy/numpy from the bitbucket repo, you can even use matplotlib from my fork at https://github.com/mattip/matplotlib but there is no gui backend available yet, so you can only save the plots to files. Watch this space for the promised blog post, hopefully next week.</p></body></html>

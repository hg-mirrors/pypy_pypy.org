<html><body><p>&gt; But then you're just benchmarking the underlying library, which is the exact same library as numpy.<br><br>Yes I agree. I just want to highlight that for most common real life use cases, a small performance overhead in those those LAPACK bindings are almost never a problem. <br><br>Otherwise your readers might be mislead into thinking that the "PyPy 2.5.0 + numpy + lapack via pure python + cffi" version is significantly suboptimal (2x slowdown!) while in practice a couple of additional microseconds might be completely undetectable compared to the actual execution time of the "inv" function that typically lasts more than a millisecond on anything that is non-toy data.</p></body></html>

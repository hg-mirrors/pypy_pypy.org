<html><body><p>Interesting work although benchmarking linear algebra routines on 10x10 arrays feels wrong: typical linear algebra applications use hundreds or thousands of dimensions. Would you mind re-rerunning those benchmarks on 1000x1000 arrays instead? The use of the CPU cache and multiple threads can be very impacting for such workloads.<br><br>Also some numpy / scipy developers are working on supporting OpenBLAS as the default BLAS/LAPACK by default for the Windows wheel packages and maybe later for the OSX packages as well.<br><br>Under Linux (Debian / Ubuntu) it's pretty easy to have libblas.so / liblapack.so be symlinks to either ATLAS or OpenBLAS using the update-alternative syste,</p></body></html>

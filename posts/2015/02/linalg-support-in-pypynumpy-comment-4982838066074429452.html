<html><body><p>&gt; The most interesting benchmark is probably the one only you can run, i.e. how does pypy perform for you on your workload.<br><br>I agree, but inverting a 10x10 matrix is probably not representative of anybody's workload.<br><br>While it's important not to introduce too much overhead in the bindings, I think it's also good to keep in mind that an overhead of the order of the micro-second is completely negligible compared to the execution time of a typical linear algebra operation running on realistically sized data. Hence my original remark.<br><br>&gt; As far as lapack vs openblas, we will try to imitate what numpy does. If cpython/numpy supports a variation of lapack and pypy/numpy doesn't, that should be considered a bug.<br><br>Just to clarify OpenBLAS is an implementation of the standard BLAS API that also includes the official LAPACK implementation from netlib linked against its own optimized BLAS routines. The 2 main open source optimized implementations of BLAS/LAPACK supported by numpy &amp; scipy are ATLAS and OpenBLAS.</p></body></html>

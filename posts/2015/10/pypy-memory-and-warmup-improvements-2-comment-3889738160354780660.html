<html><body><p>Side effect operation is one that does not have any side effects. This means that you can execute the operation again (e.g. reading a field or adding two numbers) and will affect nothing but it's result. As for redo - well, it has nothing to do with STM, but doing pure operations again can be sometimes useful (in short - if you have i = a + b, you don't remember the i, just a, b and that i = a + b)</p></body></html>

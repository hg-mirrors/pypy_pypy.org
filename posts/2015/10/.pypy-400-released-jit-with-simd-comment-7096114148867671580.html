<html><body><p>@PeteVine: to clarify, PyPy has no JIT backend emitting the old-style x87 fpu instructions.  What you are posting is very likely a PyPy whose JIT doesn't support floats at all.  It emits calls to already-compiled functions, like the one doing addition of float objects, instead of writing a SSE2 float addition on unboxed objects.<br><br>Instead, use the official PyPy and run it with vectorization turned on and off (as documented) on the same modern machine.  This allows an apple-to-apple comparison.</p></body></html>

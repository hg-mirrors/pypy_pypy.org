<html><body><p>Well, I was suggesting benchmarking the 32-bit backends to see how much difference SIMD makes - x87 means the standard fpu whereas the default uses SSE2. I know it's processor archaeology so you may have forgotten pypy even had it ;)<br><br>The ready-to-use pypy distro (built by me) was meant for anyone in possesion of a real set of benchmarks (not synthetic vector stuff) to be able to try it quickly.<br><br>And btw, you could have simply edited the dropbox link out. I'd already tested py3k using this backend and mentioned it in one of the issues on bitbucket so it's far from random.<br><br>@ all the people asking about pypy3 - you have the python 3.2 compatible pypy (py3k) at your disposal even now.</p></body></html>

Hi everyone,<br>
<br>
it took some time to catch up with the JIT refacrtorings merged in this summer. <span style="font-size: small;">But, (drums) we are happy to announce that:</span><br>
<br>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">
<span style="font-size: large;">The next release of PyPy,  "PyPy 4.0.0", will ship the new auto vectorizer</span></h2>
<span style="font-size: small;">The goal of this project was to increase the speed of numerical applications in both the NumPyPy library and for arbitrary Python programs. In PyPy we have focused a lot on improvements in the 'typical python workload',  which usually involves object and string manipulations, mostly for web development. We're hoping with this work that we'll continue improving the other very important Python use case - numerics.</span><br>
<br>
<h2>
<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: large;">What it can do!</span> </span></h2>
<span style="font-size: small;">It targets numerics only. It 
will not execute object manipulations faster, but it is capable of 
enhancing common vector and matrix operations.</span><br>
Good news is that it is not specifically targeted for the NumPy library and the PyPy 
virtual machine. Any interpreter (written in RPython) is able make use 
of the vectorization. For more information about that take a look <a href="http://pypyvecopt.blogspot.co.at/">here</a>, or consult the documentation. For the time being it is not turn on by default, so be sure to enable it by specifying <span>--jit vec=1<span style="font-family: inherit;"> </span></span>before running your program.<br>
<br>
If your language (written in RPython) contains many array/matrix operations, you can easily integrate the optimization by adding the parameter 'vec=1' to the JitDriver.<br>
<br>
<h2>
<span style="font-size: large;">NumPyPy Improvements</span></h2>
<span style="font-size: small;"></span>
<span style="font-size: small;">Let's take a look at the core functions of the NumPyPy library (*). </span><br>
<span style="font-size: small;">The following tests tests show the speedup of the core functions commonly used in Python code interfacing with NumPy, on CPython with NumPy, on the PyPy 2.6.1 relased several weeks ago, and on PyPy 15.11 to be released soon. Timeit was used to test the time needed to run the operation in the plot title on various vector (lower case) and square matrix (upper case) sizes displayed on the X axis. The Y axis shows the speedup compared to CPython 2.7.10. <b>This means that higher is better</b>. </span><br>

<span style="font-size: small;">In comparison to PyPy 2.6.1, the speedup </span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">greatly</span> improved. The hardware support really strips down the runtime of the vector and matrix operations. There is another operation we would like to highlight: the dot product.</span><br>
<span style="font-size: small;">It is a very common operation in numerics and PyPy now (given a moderate sized matrix and vector) decreases the time spent in that operation. See for yourself:</span><br>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
</div>
These are nice improvements in the NumPyPy library and we got to a competitive level only making use of SSE4.1.<br>
<br>
<h2>
<span style="font-size: large;">Future work   </span></h2>
<br>
<span style="font-size: small;">This is not the end of the road. The GSoC project showed that it is possible to implement this optimization in PyPy. There might be other improvements we can make to carry this further:</span><br>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: small;">Check alignment at runtime to increase the memory throughput of the CPU</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: small;">Support the AVX vector extension which (at least) doubles the size of the vector register</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: small;">Handle each and every corner case in Python traces to enable it  globally</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: small;">Do not rely only on loading operations to trigger the analysis, there might be cases where combination of floating point values could be done in parallel </span></li>
</ul>
Cheers,<br>

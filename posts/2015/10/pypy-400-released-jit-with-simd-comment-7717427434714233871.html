<html><body><p>The last part should have been pretty clear as it was referring to the newly added â€“jit vec=1 so it's not me who's dropping SIMD here (shorthand for different instructions sets) as can be seen in the title of this blog post. <br><br>All this time I was merely interested in comparing the two 32-bit backends, that's all. One's using the i486/x87 instruction set regardless of any jit codes, the other is able take advantage of anything up to SSE2. The quick fibonacci test was all I did so you could have pointed me to a real set of benchmarks instead of throwing these little jabs :)</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>@PeteVine: ok, there is a misunderstanding somewhere, I think. Let me try to clarify: PyPy's JIT has <i>always</i> used non-SIMD SSE2 instructions to implement floating point operations. We have a slow mode where only x87 instructions are used, but usually don't fall back to that, and it does not make sense to compare against that mode.<br><br>What the new release experimentally added is support for SIMD SSE instructions using autoparallelization when --jit vec=1 is given. This only works if your program uses numpy arrays or other simple list processing code. For details on that (and for benchmarks) it's probably best to read Richard Plangger's <a href="http://pypyvecopt.blogspot.de/" rel="nofollow">blog</a>.<br><br>Does that make sense?</p></body></html>

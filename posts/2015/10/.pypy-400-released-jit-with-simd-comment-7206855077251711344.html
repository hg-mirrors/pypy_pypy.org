<html><body><p>@Gerrit, they are 2 different things.  One is the option to say you are interested in the SIMD support and the other is a check if SIMD support is available in the HW if you are interested in using it.  I'm sure once SIMD support has been used for some time it will eventually be enabled by default but since it is new and potential could have some unknown issues at this time you have to explicitly enable it at this time.</p></body></html>

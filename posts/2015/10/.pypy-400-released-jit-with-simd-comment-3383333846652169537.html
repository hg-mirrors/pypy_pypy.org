<html><body><p>@PeteVine Sorry, I don't understand your questions.  Why do you bring the JIT-emitting performance to the table?  And why fibonacci (it's not a benchmark with floats at all)?  And I don't get the last question either ("SIMD" = "vectorization").<br><br>To some people, merely dropping the word "SIMD" into a performance discussion makes them go "ooh nice" even if they don't have a clue what it is.  I hope you're more knowledgeable than that and that I'm merely missing your point :-)</p></body></html>

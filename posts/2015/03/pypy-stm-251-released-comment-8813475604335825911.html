<html><body><p>Your comment suggests PyPy-STM doesn't actually work for you.  If you have found a bug, please contribute a bug report, even if only if you have an example of program that should parallelize and doesn't; such bug reports are very useful.  Alternatively, you're complaining that PyPy-STM is useless for you.  Maybe I've been bad at explaining what you should expect and not expect from it in the first place, so I've given you wrong expectations.  In that case, sorry.  (The 3rd alternative would be that you're just trolling, but let's discard it for now.)</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>@Anonymous: about starting at 16-bit instead of 8-bit: it doesn't give any benefit, because rehashing is needed anyway to grow the sparse table.  As long as its size is at most 256, then there is no point in storing 16-bit numbers instead of 8-bit numbers.  In theory we could store N-bit numbers for the optimal value of N (= 4, 6, 8, 10...) and pay only the cost of additional complexity for individual reads and writes, not for rehashing.</p></body></html>

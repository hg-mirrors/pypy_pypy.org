<html><body><p>Thank you for improving pypy performance and features.  Your project and method  is promising in improvement weakness aspect of dynamic languages.  At the same time, pypy should provide an simplicity of Python rather than diversity , where diversity is the reality but simplicity is the case. <br><br>Making dictionaries ordered by default is part of  simplicity; in this effort I wish integrating the features of "defaultdict" as method and properties of the the default basic dictionary.  <br><br>similar case , integrating "deque" features (as well ,method and properties) as part of pypy list datatype. <br><br>Usually I wonder why python team didn't integrate the features  of these "collections"   ( as they say "High-performance container datatypes" ) within original python basic datatype, as we all know , everything in Python is an Object.  and I don't think it is a pythonic  way to do things in diversity.<br><br>Anyhow , keep on your development and team spirit.</p></body></html>

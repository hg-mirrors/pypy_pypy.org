<html><body><p>@carl - ah I see, thats interesting.<br><br>Well then, what about storing the hashes with the indices?<br>* Another chunk of memory saved. Only the lowest N bits need be stored that way instead of the full 64 bits. (Big assumption that rehashing on bit size change is ok)<br><br>* The nice thing is that the dense part (cache miss!) need only be accessed if the hash matches.<br><br>I think if I was doing this, I'd skip 8 bit indices and have 16 bit minimum so rehashing would be very rare.</p></body></html>

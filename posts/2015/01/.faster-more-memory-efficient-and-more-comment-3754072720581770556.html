<html><body><p>@Durtin: there are certainly slow-downs in some cases.  If the dictionary is cold, then indeed there is one extra cache miss. It seems to be quickly compensated, though, by the fact that if then you do a few more accesses to the same dict, you are likely to get less cache misses, simply because of the more compact layout.  Also, the index array is often single bytes, so it can be fully in the cache very quickly.</p></body></html>

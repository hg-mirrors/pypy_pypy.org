<html><body><p>@Alhabshi3k: indeed, you're right in that "defaultdict" could be replaced with an alternate constructor of the regular dicts.  I'm not sure why it is not so.  For deques, it is maybe a question of performance, but particularly of underlying C-level memory layout: CPython can't easily add appendleft() and popleft() to regular lists while still keeping the same C API, notably PyList_GET_ITEM() and PySequence_Fast_ITEMS() --- though that is debatable.<br><br>We could support that in PyPy, but that is arguably more of a language change than just making dicts ordered with no new user-visible API.</p></body></html>

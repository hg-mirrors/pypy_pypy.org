<html><body><p>You say for 100 elements, the new design's compact array uses 3 * WORD * 100 memory, right? So no extra capacity whatsoever? Then what do you do when I insert another element? Allocate a new array with 3 * WORD * 101 memory and copy all data there (and write the new element at the end)? That would be highly inefficient. So I don't believe you're honest about the memory usage.</p></body></html>

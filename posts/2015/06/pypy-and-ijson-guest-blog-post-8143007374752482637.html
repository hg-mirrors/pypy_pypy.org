This gem was posted in the <a href="https://github.com/isagalaev/ijson/issues/35" target="_blank">ijson issue tracker</a> after some discussion on #pypy, and Dav1dde kindly allowed us to repost it here:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">"</span>So, I was playing around with parsing huge JSON files (19GiB, testfile is ~520MiB) and wanted to try a sample code with PyPy, turns out, PyPy needed ~1:30-2:00 whereas CPython 2.7 needed ~13 seconds (the pure python implementation on both pythons was equivalent at ~8 minutes). <br><br>"Apparantly ctypes is really bad performance-wise, especially on PyPy. So I made a quick <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cffi">CFFI</a> mockup: <a href="https://gist.github.com/Dav1dde/c509d472085f9374fc1d">https://gist.github.com/Dav1dde/c509d472085f9374fc1d</a><br>
<br>
Before:<br>
<br>CPython 2.7: <br><span>    python -m emfas.server size dumps/echoprint-dump-1.json <br>    11.89s user 0.36s system 98% cpu 12.390 total </span><br>
PYPY: <br><span>    python -m emfas.server size dumps/echoprint-dump-1.json <br>    117.19s user 2.36s system 99% cpu 1:59.95 total </span><br><br>
After (CFFI):<br><br> CPython 2.7: <br><span>     python jsonsize.py ../dumps/echoprint-dump-1.json<br>      8.63s user 0.28s system 99% cpu 8.945 total </span><br>
PyPy: <br><span>     python jsonsize.py ../dumps/echoprint-dump-1.json <br>     4.04s user 0.34s system 99% cpu 4.392 total

<br><br>Dav1dd goes into more detail in the issue itself, but we just want to emphasize a few significant points from this brief interchange:<br>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>His CFFI implementation is faster than the ctypes one even on CPython 2.7.</li>
<li>PyPy + CFFI is faster than CPython even when using C code to do the heavy parsing.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Conservancy and PyPy's great work together</h1>

<p><a href="https://pypy.org/">PyPy</a> joined <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/">Conservancy</a> in
the <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2011/jan/02/oct-dec-2010/">second half of 2010</a>, shortly after the release of
PyPy 1.2, the first version to contain a fully functional JIT. <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/550427/">In 2013</a>, PyPy
started supporting ARM, bringing its just-in-time speediness to many more devices and began working toward supporting NumPy to help
scientists crunch their numbers faster. Together, PyPy and Conservancy ran successful fundraising drives and facilitated payment
and oversight for <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2016/dec/01/pypy-2016/">contractors and code sprints</a>.</p>

<p>Conservancy supported PyPy's impressive growth as it expanded support for
different hardware platforms, greatly improved the performance of C extensions,
and added support for Python 3 as the language itself evolved.</p>

<h1>The road ahead</h1>
  
<p>Conservancy provides a fiscal and organizational home for projects that find the
freedoms and guardrails that come along with a charitable home advantageous for
their community goals. While this framework was a great fit for the early PyPy
community, times change and all good things must come to an end.</p>

<p>PyPy will remain a free and open source project, but the community's structure
and organizational underpinnings will be changing and the PyPy community will be
exploring options outside of the charitable realm for its next phase of growth
("charitable" in the legal sense -- PyPy will remain a community project).</p>

<p>During the last year PyPy and Conservancy have worked together to properly
utilise the generous donations made by stalwart PyPy enthusiats over the years
and to wrap up PyPy's remaining charitable obligations. PyPy is grateful for
the Conservancy's help in shepherding the project toward its next chapter.</p>

<h1>Thank yous</h1><p>From Conservancy: <br></p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><blockquote>"We are happy that Conservancy was able to help PyPy bring important software
for the public good during a critical time in its history. We wish the
community well and look forward to seeing it develop and succeed in new ways." <br></blockquote><blockquote>— Karen Sandler, Conservancy's Executive Director</blockquote><p></p><p>From PyPy:</p><p></p><div style="text-align: left;"><div style="text-align: left;"><blockquote><p>"PyPy would like to thank Conservancy for their decade long support in
building the community and wishes Conservancy continued success in their
journey promoting, improving, developing and defending free and open source
sofware." <br></p></blockquote><blockquote><p style="text-align: left;">— Simon Cross &amp; Carl Friedrich Bolz-Tereick, on behalf of PyPy.</p></blockquote></div></div><p></p><blockquote>

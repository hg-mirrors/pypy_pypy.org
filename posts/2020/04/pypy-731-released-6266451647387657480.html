The PyPy team is proud to release the version 7.3.1 of PyPy, which includes
two different interpreters:<br>

<blockquote>
<div>
<ul class="simple">
<li>PyPy2.7, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 2.7 including the stdlib for CPython 2.7.13</li>
<li>PyPy3.6: which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 3.6, including the stdlib for CPython 3.6.9.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</blockquote>
The interpreters are based on much the same codebase, thus the multiple
release. This is a micro release, no APIs have changed since the 7.3.0 release
in December, but read on to find out what is new.<br>

<br>
Conda Forge now <a class="reference external" href="https://conda-forge.org/blog//2020/03/10/pypy">supports PyPy</a> as a Python interpreter. The support right now
is being built out. After this release, many more c-extension-based
packages can be successfully built and uploaded. This is the result of a lot of
hard work and good will on the part of the Conda Forge team.  A big shout out
to them for taking this on.<br>

<br>
We have worked with the Python packaging group to support tooling around
building third party packages for Python, so this release updates the pip and
setuptools installed when executing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pypy</span> <span class="pre">-mensurepip</span></code> to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pip&gt;=20</span></code>. This
completes the work done to update the PEP 425 <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0425/#python-tag">python tag</a> from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pp373</span></code> to
mean “PyPy 7.3 running python3” to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pp36</span></code> meaning “PyPy running Python
3.6” (the format is recommended in the PEP). The tag itself was
changed in 7.3.0, but older pip versions build their own tag without querying
PyPy. This means that wheels built for the previous tag format will not be
discovered by pip from this version, so library authors should update their
PyPy-specific wheels on PyPI.<br>

<br>
Development of PyPy is transitioning to <a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy">https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy</a>.
This move was covered more extensively in the <a class="reference external" href="https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2020/02/pypy-and-cffi-have-moved-to-heptapod.html">blog post</a> from last month.<br>

<br>
The <a class="reference external" href="http://cffi.readthedocs.io/">CFFI</a> backend has been updated to version 14.0. We recommend using CFFI
rather than c-extensions to interact with C, and using <a class="reference external" href="https://cppyy.readthedocs.io/">cppyy</a> for performant
wrapping of C++ code for Python. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cppyy</span></code> backend has been enabled
experimentally for win32, try it out and let use know how it works.<br>

<br>
Enabling <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cppyy</span></code> requires a more modern C compiler, so win32 is now built
with MSVC160 (Visual Studio 2019). This is true for PyPy 3.6 as well as for 2.7.<br>

<br>
We have improved warmup time by up to 20%, performance of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">io.StringIO</span></code> to
match if not be faster than CPython, and improved JIT code generation for
generators (and generator expressions in particular) when passing them to
functions like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sum</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">map</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">map</span></code> that consume them. Performance of closures has also be improved in certain situations.<br>

<br>
As always, this release fixed several issues and bugs raised by the growing
community of PyPy users.  We strongly recommend updating. Many of the fixes are
the direct result of end-user bug reports, so please continue reporting issues
as they crop up.<br>

We would like to thank our donors for the continued support of the PyPy
project. If PyPy is not quite good enough for your needs, we are available for
direct consulting work.<br>

<br>
We would also like to thank our contributors and encourage new people to join
the project. PyPy has many layers and we need help with all of them: <a class="reference external" href="http://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/index.html">PyPy</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.org/">RPython</a> documentation improvements, tweaking popular modules to run
on PyPy, or general <a class="reference external" href="http://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/project-ideas.html">help</a> with making RPython’s JIT even better. Since the
previous release, we have accepted contributions from 13 new contributors,
thanks for pitching in.<br>

<br>
If you are a Python library maintainer and use c-extensions, please consider
making a cffi / cppyy version of your library that would be performant on PyPy.
In any case both <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/joerick/cibuildwheel">cibuildwheel</a> and the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/matthew-brett/multibuild">multibuild system</a> support
building wheels for PyPy wheels.<br>

<span style="font-size: x-large;">What is PyPy?</span></h2>
PyPy is a very compliant Python interpreter, almost a drop-in replacement for
CPython 2.7, 3.6, and soon 3.7. It’s fast (<a class="reference external" href="http://speed.pypy.org/">PyPy and CPython 2.7.x</a> performance
comparison) due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.<br>

<br>
We also welcome developers of other <a class="reference external" href="http://rpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html">dynamic languages</a> to see what RPython
can do for them.<br>

<br>
This PyPy release supports:<br>

<blockquote>
<div>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>x86</strong> machines on most common operating systems
(Linux 32/64 bits, Mac OS X 64 bits, Windows 32 bits, OpenBSD, FreeBSD)</li>
<li>big- and little-endian variants of <strong>PPC64</strong> running Linux,</li>
<li><strong>s390x</strong> running Linux</li>
<li>64-bit <strong>ARM</strong> machines running Linux.</li>
</ul>

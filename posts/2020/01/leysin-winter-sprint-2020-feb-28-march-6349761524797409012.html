time.  This is a fully public sprint: newcomers and topics other than
those proposed below are welcome.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>
Goals and topics of the sprint</h3>
The list of topics is open.  For reference, we would like to work at least partially on the following topics:<br>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pyhandle/hpy">HPy</a> </li>
<li>Python 3.7 support (<a href="http://buildbot.pypy.org/summary?branch=py3.7">buildbot status</a>)</li>
</ul>
As usual, the main side goal is to have fun in winter sports :-)
We can take a day off (for ski or anything else).<br>
<br>
<h3>
Times and accomodation</h3>
The sprint will occur for one week starting on Saturday, the 29th of February, to Sunday, the 8th of March 2020 <b>(dates were pushed back one day!)</b>  It will occur in <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/ch/les-airelles.html">Les Airelles</a>, a different bed-and-breakfast place from the traditional one in <span class="il">Leysin</span>.  It is a nice old house at the top of the village.<br>
<br>
<strike>We have a 4- or 5-people room as well as up to three double-rooms.  Please register early!  These rooms are not booked for the sprint in advance, and might be already taken if you end up announcing yourself late.</strike>  We have a big room for up to 7 people with nice view, which might be split in two or three sub-rooms; plus possibly separately-booked double rooms if needed. (But it is of course always possible to book at a different place in Leysin.)<br>

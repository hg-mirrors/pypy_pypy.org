<html><body><p>I do not use regular expressions very heavily and am very new to pypy in general (1.2 works pretty good for me on my pure python code).  From this article I don't see a full explaination why this basic algorithm couldn't be used for pypy.  Is it primarily due to concerns about backward compatiblity or something more interesting?  I am looking forward to the article to come about applying the JIT.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>rawdog (disclosure of bias: I wrote it) sounds like it might be of use. It's an RSS aggregator that generates static HTML. Pure Python 2, with lots of string processing, mostly in the feedparser module. Memory usage and runtime depends on how many feeds it's reading and how much history it keeps, since it does everything in memory at the moment, using pickle for persistant state. (With my 800-odd feeds and two-month history, writing the entire store to HTML will use a few hundred meg of memory and run for several minutes.)<br><br>A future redesign will use a more sensible database-backed approach...</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>@Alex: nice. pypyenv is obviously something different that virtualenv-pypy, but it might be useful if someone wants to try PyPy.<br><br>However, I don't think that sharing site-packages is a good idea: it works as long as you have only pure python packages, but it stops as soon as you build some C extension, as the .so produced by PyPy are incompatible with CPython</p></body></html>

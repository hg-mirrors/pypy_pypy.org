<html><body><p>This weekend I delivered a talk at <a class="reference external" href="http://pyohio.org/">PyOhio</a> (an annual conference in Columbus, OH, USA) on PyPy and Unladen Swallow.  The talk covered reasons that Python, the language, is hard to optimize, why CPython is slow, and a few optimizations that PyPy and Unladen Swallow have implemented.  The slides from my talk are <a class="reference external" href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/35240506/Making-Python-Fast-PyPy-and-Unladen-Swallow">online</a>, and the talk was recorded so a video will follow.  I gave a similar talk to <a class="reference external" href="http://chipy.org/">ChiPy</a> (the Chicago Python user group), which was also recorded and the video is <a class="reference external" href="http://carlfk.blip.tv/file/3866910">available</a>.  Both audiences were excited about the futures for PyPy and Unladen Swallow, and for the future of a faster Python.</p>

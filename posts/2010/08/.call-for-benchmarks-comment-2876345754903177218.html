<html><body><p>Scapy would be a great one to benchmark.  Depending on the size of the packet capture, it can consume quite a bit of proc/mem when loading and dissecting large captures.  I run it at work on Cpython and would love to see it running/optimized under pypy.  The only problem is that I believe it uses some 2.6 pythonisms.</p></body></html>

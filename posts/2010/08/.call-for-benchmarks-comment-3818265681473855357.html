<html><body><p>I'm the author of a scientific application that can be suited to your needs. It runs both with Python 2.x and PyPy, so I bundled a distribution with some example benchmarks if this interests you: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7931953/pypy-bench.tar.bz2 (see bench.README)<br><br>An interesting observation in my opinion is that on small runs, CPython outperforms PyPy but this progressively reverses on longer runs.</p></body></html>

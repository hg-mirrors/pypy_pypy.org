<html><body><p>The CDPedia creates and manipulates its index with a pure-python inverted index implementation.<br><br>It could be extracted and made into a benchmark - there are other pure-python inverted indices around, those could also work.<br><br>They do tend to use lots and lots of memory, the CDPedia's implementation uses the builtin array module for byte sequence manipulation and bare strings as data store (it's highly optimized for lowering CPython's memory usage), but there are a few dict-heavy places yet.</p></body></html>

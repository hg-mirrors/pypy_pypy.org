<html><body><p>Wonderful idea, great implementation (axis are needed, <a href="http://people.iola.dk/olau/flot/examples/interacting.html" rel="nofollow">tooltips</a> would be interesting for long series), <b>impressive</b> results.<br><br>I hope you guys exploit this to raise interest in PyPy in this pre-release period. Just take a look at the response you get to posts involving numbers, benchmarks, etc. (BTW, keep linking to the funding post) :)<br><br>A series of short posts discussing hot topics would be a sure way to keep Pypy around the news until the release, so you get as much feedback as possible.<br><br>Suggestions:<br><br> - Possible factors in slower results (discuss points in the <a href="http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2009/11/some-benchmarking.html" rel="nofollow">Some Benchmarking</a> post);<br><br> - One-of comparisons to different CPython versions, Unladen Swallow, ShedSkin, [C|J|IronP]ython (revisit old benchmarks posts?);<br><br> - Mention oprofile and the need for better profiling tools in blog, so you can crowdsource a review of options;<br><br> - Ping the <a href="http://www.phoronix-test-suite.com/" rel="nofollow">Phoronix Test Suite</a> folks to include Pypy translation (or even these benchmarks) in their tests: Python is an important part of Linux distros;<br><br> - Don't be afraid to post <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/archives/2009/12/firefox_35_is_the_mo.html" rel="nofollow">press-quotable numbers and pics</a>, blurbs about what Pypy is and how much it's been improving, etc. Mention unrelated features of the interpreter (sandboxable!), the framework (free JIT for other languages), whatever;<br><br> - The benchmark platform (code, hardware, plans for new features).</p></body></html>

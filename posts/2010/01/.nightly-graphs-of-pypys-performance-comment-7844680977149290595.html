<html><body><p>Hey.<br><br>Regarding revisions - by default it points to the first one we have graphs from, so you can just slice :) Also, yeah, revision numbers and dates should show up, will fix that. We don't build nightly unladen swallow and we don't want to run it against some older version, because they're improving constantly.<br><br>Cheers,<br>fijal</p></body></html>

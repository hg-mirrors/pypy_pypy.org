<html><body><p>Hello.</p>
<p>In the past few months, we made tremendous <a class="reference external" href="http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2009/11/some-benchmarking.html">progress</a> on the JIT front.
To monitor the progress daily, we introduced recently some <a class="reference external" href="http://buildbot.pypy.org/plotsummary.html">cool graphs</a>
that plot revision vs performance. They are based on <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/unladen-swallow/">unladen swallow</a>
benchmark runner and they're written entirely in JavaScript, using canvas
via the <a class="reference external" href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/flot/">Flot</a> libraries.
It's amazing what you can do in JavaScript these days... They are also
tested via the very good <a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/oejskit">oejskit</a> plugin, that integrates <a class="reference external" href="http://codespeak.net/py/dist/test/">py.test</a>
with JavaScript testing, driven by the command line.</p>
<p>As you can probably see, we're very good on some benchmarks and not that
great on others. Some of the bad results come from the fact that while we
did a lot of JIT-related work, other PyPy parts did not see that much
love. Some of our algorithms on the builtin data types are inferior to those
of CPython. This is going to be an ongoing focus for a while.</p>
<p>We want to first improve on the benchmarks for a couple
of weeks before doing a release to gather further feedback.</p>
<p>Cheers,

<html><body><p>Hello.</p>
<p>Greetings to everybody from Pycon 2010 Atlanta. Right now I'm sitting in
a sprint room with people sprinting on various projects, like <a class="reference external" href="http://python.org">CPython</a>,
twisted etc. The conference was really great, and I've seen some good talks,
although I've been too exhausted from <a class="reference external" href="http://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/extradoc/talk/pycon2010/keynote/talk.pdf">my</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/extradoc/talk/pycon2010/crossinterp/talk.pdf">own</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/extradoc/talk/pycon2010/pypyspeed/talk.pdf">talks</a> to go to too many.
Probably I should stay away from proposing that many talks to next pycon :-)</p>
<p>The highlight of sprints was that we got a common mercurial repository at python.org for python benchmarks. We might be able to come up with
"the python benchmark suite" which will mostly consist 
of simple benchmarks using large python libraries, rather than microbenchmarks.
The repository was started by the <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/unladen-swallow/">Unladen Swallow</a> people and we already
have common commit access among PyPy, CPython, Unladen Swallow, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.jython.org/">Jython</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="http://ironpython.net/">Iron Python</a>. We don't have yet a common place to run benchmarks,
but we should be able to fix that soon.</p>
<p>Regarding the talks, there are online videos for
<a class="reference external" href="http://pycon.blip.tv/file/3261260/">How to write cross-interpreter python programs</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://pycon.blip.tv/file/3259650/">Speed of PyPy</a> talks,
among other talks from Pycon.
There should be a video for my short keynote shortly.</p>
<p>The talks were well received as there is interest in PyPy's progress.</p><p>
</p><p>Cheers,<br>

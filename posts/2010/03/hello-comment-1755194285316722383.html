<html><body><p>@Luis<br><br>other than Maciek's points, which I subscribe, it should be said<br>that, since each language has a different semantics, the<br>efficiency of a traditional "method-at-a-time" JIT can vary<br>dramatically.  In particular, the dynamism of Python is so deep<br>that a traditional JIT cannot win much: Jython and IronPython do<br>exactly that, but for most use cases are slower than CPython.  If<br>you are interested, Chapter 2 of my PhD thesis explores these<br>topics :-)<br>http://codespeak.net/svn/user/antocuni/phd/thesis/thesis.pdf</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>Hello.</p>
<p>I recently did some benchmarking of <a class="reference external" href="http://twistedmatrix.com">twisted</a> on top of PyPy. For the very
impatient: <b>PyPy is up to 285% faster than CPython</b>. For more patient people,
there is a full explanation of what I did and how I performed measurments,
so they can judge themselves.</p>
<p>The benchmarks are living in <a class="reference external" href="https://code.launchpad.net/~exarkun/+junk/twisted-benchmarks">twisted-benchmarks</a> and were mostly written
by <a class="reference external" href="http://jcalderone.livejournal.com/">Jean Paul Calderone</a>. Even though he called them "initial exploratory
investigation into a potential direction for future development resulting
in performance oriented metrics guiding the process of optimization and
avoidance of complexity regressions", they're still much much better than
average benchmarks found out there.</p>
<p>The methodology was to run each benchmark for
quite some time (about 1 minute), measuring number of requests each 5s.
Then I looked at <a class="reference external" href="http://codespeak.net/svn/user/fijal/txt/twisted-data.txt">dump</a> of data and substracted some time it took
for JIT-capable interpreters to warm up (up to 15s), averaging
everything after that. Averages of requests per second are in the table below (the higher the better):</p>

<p>To reproduce, run each benchmark with:</p>
<blockquote>
benchname.py -n 12 -d 5</blockquote>
<p><em>WARNING</em>: running tcp-based benchmarks that open new connection for each
request (web &amp; accept) can exhaust number of some kernel structures,
limit <strong>n</strong> or wait until next run if you see drops in request per second.</p>
<p>The first obvious thing is that various benchmarks are more or less amenable
to speedups by JIT compilation. Accept and tcp getting smallest speedups, if at
all. This is understandable, since JIT is mostly about reducing interpretation
and frame overhead, which is probably not large when it comes to accepting
connections. However, if you actually loop around, doing something, JIT
can give you a lot of speedup.</p>
<p>The other obvious thing is that <b>PyPy is the fastest python interpreter
here</b>, almost across-the board (Jython and IronPython won't run twisted),
except for raw tcp throughput. However, speedups can vary and I expect
this to improve after the release, as there are points, where PyPy can
be improved. Regarding raw tcp throughput - this can be a problem for
some applications and we're looking forward to improve this particular
bit.</p>
<p>The main reason to use twisted for this comparison is a lot of support from
twisted team and JP Calderone in particular, especially when it comes to
providing benchmarks. If some open source project wants to be looked at
by PyPy team, please <b>provide a reasonable set of benchmarks and infrastructure</b>.</p>
<p>If, however, you're a closed source project fighting with performance problems
of Python, we're providing <b>contracting for investigating opportunities</b>, how
PyPy and not only PyPy, can speed up your project.</p>

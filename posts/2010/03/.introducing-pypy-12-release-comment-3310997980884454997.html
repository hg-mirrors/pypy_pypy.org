<html><body><p>Forgot about the memory usage, python consume ~4MB and pypy consume ~24MB. Pypy need 6x more memory, but I don't care about this in my script since the performance gain is significant. <br><br>I really want to know the pypy vs luajit, I think luajit should be much faster. I am in progress in converting my script to lua but that is painful, my knowledge on lua doesn't match with python.</p></body></html>

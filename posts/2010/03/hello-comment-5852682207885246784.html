<html><body><p>Question: After having read many comments and posts from pypy's developers lately, I got the impression (I might be wrong though), that you are betting all on tracing for getting speedups, (that the slow interpreter will eventually be compensated by the magic of tracing).<br>However, other projects that rely on tracing seem to favor a dual approach, which is a traditional method-a-time jit (which can evenly speed up all kinds of code) plus tracing for getting the most of highly numerical code (luajit 2.0, mozila's jaegermonkey, for example).<br><br>Is this accurate or I'm wrong? Do you think that the current tracing strategy will eventually get speedups for those benchamarks that are currently on par or way bellow cpython? Or will you have to add a more traditional approach for the baseline?</p></body></html>

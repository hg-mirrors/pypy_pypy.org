<html><body><p>Another silly question:<br>AFAIK, the benchmark improvements seen lately are due to the way you measure avergages, by excluding warmup time. Seeing that warmup takes time that may be critical in some situations, I wonder if it's possible to somehow "save" the generated jited code so it can be reused after the first time it's generated.<br>This way, it would be possible to distribute programs already "warmed up", kind of a compiled version of them. Sorry if this doesn't make sense at all... for a clueless ignorant like me, it does!</p></body></html>

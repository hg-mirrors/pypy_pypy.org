<html><body><p>Hello.</p>
<p>Some time ago, we introduced our <a class="reference external" href="http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2010/01/nightly-graphs-of-pypys-performance.html">nightly performance graphs</a>. This was a quick
hack to allow us to see performance regressions. Thanks to Miquel Torres,
we can now introduce <a class="reference external" href="http://speed.pypy.org">http://speed.pypy.org</a>, which is a Django-powered web
app sporting a more polished visualisation of our nightly performance runs.</p>
<p>While this website is not finished yet, it's already far better than our previous
approach :-)</p>
<p>Details about announcement on pypy-dev are found <a class="reference external" href="http://codespeak.net/pipermail/pypy-dev/2010q1/005643.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you're are interested in having something similar for other benchmark runs, contact Miquel (tobami at gmail).</p>
<p>Quoting Miquel: "<i>I would also like to note, that if other performance-oriented
opensource projects are interested, I would be willing to see if we can set-up
such a Speed Center for them. There are already people interested in
contributing to make it into a framework to be plugged into buildbots, software
forges and the like. Stay tuned!</i>"</p></body></html>

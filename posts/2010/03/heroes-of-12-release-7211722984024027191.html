<html><body><p>Now that the release is done I wanted to list and to thank some people that
were essential in the process of getting it out of the door, particularly
because the work of some of them is not very visible usually.</p>
<p><strong>Armin Rigo</strong> and <strong>Maciej Fija≈Çkowski</strong> tirelessly worked on most aspects of
the release, be it fixing the last known bugs and performance problems,
packaging or general wizardry.</p>
<p><strong>Amaury Forgeot d'Arc</strong> made sure that PyPy 1.2 actually supports Windows as a
platform properly and compiled the Windows binaries.</p>
<p><strong>Miquel Torres</strong> designed and implemented our new speed overview page,
<a class="reference external" href="http://speed.pypy.org/">http://speed.pypy.org</a> which is a great tool for us to spot performance
regressions and to showcase our improvements to the general public.</p>
<p><strong>tav</strong> designed the new user-oriented web page, <a class="reference external" href="http://pypy.org/">http://pypy.org</a> which is a lot
nicer for people that only want to use PyPy as a Python implementation (and not
be confused by how PyPy is actually made).</p>
<p><strong>Holger Krekel</strong> fixed our main development server codespeak.net, even while
being on vacation and not really having online connectivity. Without that, we
couldn't actually have released anything.</p>
<p><strong>Bartosz Skowron</strong> worked a lot on making Ubuntu packages for PyPy, which is
really cool. Even though he didn't quite finish in time for the release, we will
hopefully get them soon.</p>
<p>Thanks to all you guys!</p></body></html>

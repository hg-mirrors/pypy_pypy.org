<html><body><p>@fijal Why so? 32bit libraries are available on ubuntu (with ia32 suffix), kernel is build with 32bit support option. Don't see any problem here.<br>I understand why not to build 64bit release - JIT is the goal.<br>P.S. Maybe unavailable amd64 build would force someone to digg and fix that issue? =) Are there any guides available to do it?</p></body></html>

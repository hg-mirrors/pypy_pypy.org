<html><body><p>Question: <br>According to the Computer Language Benchmarks Game, there are three benchmarks that perform way slower in Pypy against Python 3 ( see here: http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/benchmark.php?test=all&amp;lang=pypy&amp;lang2=python3 ).<br><br>Those are:<br>1) reverse-complement<br>2) regex-dna<br>3) pidgits<br><br>I know that regex-dna performs slower because regex haven't been optimized yet, but what's the reason for the other two? Do they use regex too?</p></body></html>

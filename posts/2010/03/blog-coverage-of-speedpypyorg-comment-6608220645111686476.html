<html><body><p>First of all congratulations for the great work, I can say I am a newbie in Python world but I follow with interest this project. I tryed the release with the JIT compiler with also the parallel python module and the speed gain is sensible. I compared also the performance with psyco on 3 or 4 benchmarks and it seems that the time for the execution is usually more or less the same. Do you think there will be the possibility again for a massive speed improvement in future releases or the level of max performance is not so far? How much faster could it be in the future?<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Paolo</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>@Nelson: If you don't change the "and" and "or" you get a lot of assembler code generated, and it's not particularly fast.<br><br>Note that this "and" and "or" business is quite specific to this particular example. Usually you can work more incrementally by generating a JIT, then looking at the produced assembler and then doing some small changes in the interpreter to improve parts of it. Each such change is usually localized to one part of the interpreter improves the performance of some language feature.<br><br>This example is not really large enough to show this way of working, though :-). Maybe at some point I should write a walk-through for some interpreter.</p></body></html>

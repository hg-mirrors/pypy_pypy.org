<html><body><p>I fear not.  The bytecode set is quite custom, made to represent RPython code, which is at the level (roughly speaking) of Java -- with a few additional instructions to guide the JIT compiler.  The latest version uses a register-based machine, which is more convenient than a Java-like stack-based approach starting from the control flow graphs of RPython functions.  It has three independent sets of registers: integers, pointers, and floating-point (pointers are different from integers at this level because the GC needs to track them and possibly move them).  Register numbers are encoded in one byte, so there is room for 256 registers of each kind, but in practice doing a simple register allocation step on each graph means that no bytecode ends up using more than ~15 registers.  A few parts are needed only by the JIT compiler and not by the blackhole interpreter; these are encoded "off-line" to avoid slowing down the blackhole interpreter.<br><br>Well, I could talk at length about all the details of the format, but in truth there is nothing very deep there :-)  See the comments in http://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/trunk/pypy/jit/codewriter/codewriter.py as well as the tests like test/test_flatten.py and test/test_regalloc.py.</p></body></html>

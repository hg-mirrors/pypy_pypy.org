<html><body><p>Hi Zeev.<br><br>Only at the next iteration of the loop. However, you have to have at least ~1000 iterations before it happens.<br><br>There is a variety of tools that we use for inspecting generated loops. There is no programmable interface from python yet, but there are some external tools.<br><br>Run: PYPYJITLOG=jit-log-opt:log pypy <br><br>and you'll get a file log which contains all the loops. There are tools in the source checkout pypy/jit/tool, loopviewer.py, showstats.py and traceviewer.py which can help you viewing those loops. They'll contain debug_merge_points which are with info about python opcodes (including functions and file), but they can span several functions. Have fun :)<br><br>If you want more info, drop by on #pypy at irc.freenode.net.<br><br>Cheers,<br>fijal</p></body></html>

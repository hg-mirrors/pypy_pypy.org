<html><body><p>Hello.</p>
<p>We're please to announce the release of <a href="http://pypy.org/download.html">PyPy 1.3</a>. This release has two major
improvements. First of all, we stabilized the JIT compiler since 1.2 release,
answered user issues, fixed bugs, and generally improved speed.</p>
<p>We're also pleased to announce alpha support for loading CPython extension
modules written in C. While the main purpose of this release is increased
stability, this feature is in alpha stage and it is not yet suited for
production environments.</p>
<div class="section" id="highlight-of-this-release">
<h3>Highlights of this release</h3>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">We introduced support for CPython extension modules written in C. As of now,
this support is in alpha, and it's very unlikely unaltered C extensions will
work out of the box, due to missing functions or refcounting details. The
support is disabled by default, so you have to do:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
import cpyext
</pre>
<p>before trying to import any .so file. Also, libraries are source-compatible
and not binary-compatible. That means you need to recompile binaries, using
for example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
pypy setup.py build
</pre>
<p>Details may vary, depending on your build system. Make sure you include
the above line at the beginning of setup.py or put it in your PYTHONSTARTUP.</p>
<p>This is alpha feature. It'll likely segfault. You have been warned!</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">JIT bugfixes. A lot of bugs reported for the JIT have been fixed, and its
stability greatly improved since 1.2 release.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Various small improvements have been added to the JIT code, as well as a great
speedup of compiling time.</p>
</li>
</ul>

Cheers,<br>
Maciej Fijalkowski, Armin Rigo, Alex Gaynor, Amaury Forgeot d'Arc and the PyPy team

<b>Update:</b>The correct command to build extension is "pypy setup.py build", not "python setup.py build" as it was stated before.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>@Luis: just to expand a bit Armin's answer :-).<br><br>Jaegermonkey is a method-by-method compiler that Tracemonkey uses *before* the tracing compiler enters in action. In pypy, this is equivalent to the normal Python interpreter that profiles your loops to find the hot ones, with the obvious difference that Jaegermonkey is a compiler, while ours is an interpreter.<br><br>The blackhole interpreter is something that it's used internally by our tracing jit compiler, and AFAIK it has no equivalent in tracemonkey.</p></body></html>

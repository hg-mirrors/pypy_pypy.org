<html><body><p>Hello.</p>
<p>This year we had a record of two and a half applications (one was on a cross
section of PyPy and numpy) accepted for the <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Google
SoC program</a>. Since it ended a couple of weeks ago, we wanted to present the results that
were achieved. All three projects were completed successfully, although the rate
of success varied quite a bit.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://ademan.wordpress.com/">Numpy proposal</a> progress significantly on making numpy compatible with
PyPy's CPython's <a class="reference external" href="http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2010/04/using-cpython-extension-modules-with.html">extension module support</a>, but failed to bring PyPy's numpy
implementation into a usable shape (which is a somewhat ambitious goal, one
might argue). The experiments done during the projects are living on the
<a class="reference external" href="http://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/branch/micronumpy/">micronumpy</a> branch.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://hack.bartskowron.com/">Fast ctypes</a> proposal did some useful experiments on how to JIT external
calls from PyPy to C, however, the actual code as of now is not very
interesting and it's quite far from providing a full ctypes replacement (or
equivalent).</p>
<p>Definitely the most successful proposal was a <a class="reference external" href="http://jcreigh.blogspot.com/2010/08/pypy-gsoc-64-bit-jit-merged-to-trunk.html">64bit (x86_64) backend</a> for PyPy's
JIT. It not only includes working 64bit JIT (merged into PyPy trunk), but also
a working asmgcc for x86_64 linux platform, that makes it possible to run the JIT
on this architecture with our advanced garbage collectors. One can say that
x64_64 is now no longer a second-class citizen for PyPy, although it definitely
didn't receive as much testing as the x86 platform. Expect this to be a major
selling point for the next PyPy release :-)</p>

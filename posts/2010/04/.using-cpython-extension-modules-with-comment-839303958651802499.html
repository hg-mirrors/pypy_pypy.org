<html><body><p>@Anonymous: No it's not in the PPA. We provide only the latest release (1.2 in this case) and weekly builds for trunk (which haven't been announced on the blog yet). CPython extension modules live in their own branch. The branch will be merged into the trunk sooner or later.<br><br>PS. The weekly builds are available here at https://launchpad.net/~pypy</p></body></html>

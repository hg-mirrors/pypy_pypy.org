<html><body><p>what about embedding pypy? will this work too in the future?<br><br>the reason i ask is blender. there were some security concerns among blender developers recently. blender uses embedded cpython for scripting. normal scripts (like exporters) which have to be evoked by the user aren't that much of a problem but blender also supports python expressions for animation parameters. without a sandbox downloading and opening .blend files from unknown sources is kind of risky since a malicious python expression theoretically could wipe your harddisk.<br><br>pypy with its support for a sandbox could be a very good replacement for cpython in blender (also because of its speed) but if it isn't compatible with the cpython api then a swap probably would be way too much effort.</p></body></html>

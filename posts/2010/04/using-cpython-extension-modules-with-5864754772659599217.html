<html><body><p>PyPy is now able to load
and run CPython extension modules (i.e. .pyd and .so files) natively by using the new CPyExt
subsystem.
Unlike the solution presented in <a class="reference external" href="http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2009/11/using-cpython-extension-modules-with.html">another blog post</a> (where extension modules like
numpy etc. were run on CPython and proxied through TCP), this solution does not require
a running CPython anymore. We do not achieve full binary compatiblity
yet (like Ironclad), but recompiling the extension is generally enough.</p>
<p>The only prerequisite is that the necessary functions of the C API of CPython are already
implemented in PyPy. If you are a user or an author of a module and miss certain functions
in PyPy, we invite you to implement them. Up until now, a lot of people (including a lot of
new committers) have stepped up and implemented a few functions to get their favorite module
running. See the end of this post for a list of names.</p>
<p>Regarding speed, we tried the following: even though there is a bit of overhead when running
these modules, we could run the regular expression engine of CPython (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_sre.so</span></tt>) and execute
the spambayes benchmark of the Unladen Swallow benchmark suite (cf. <a class="reference external" href="http://speed.pypy.org/">speed.pypy.org</a>) and
experience a speedup:
It became <em>two times faster</em> on pypy-c than with the built-in regular
expression engine of PyPy. From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law">Amdahl's Law</a> it follows that the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_sre.so</span></tt> must run several
times faster than the built-in engine.</p>
<p>Currently pursued modules include PIL and others. Distutils support is nearly ready.

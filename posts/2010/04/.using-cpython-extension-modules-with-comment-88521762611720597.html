<html><body><p>Let me ask for a bit more detail. I depend on a module (http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/lzhang10/maxent_toolkit.html), that is currently unsupported, as far as I know. I'd really like to port it to pypy. Where to start?<br><br>Is it possible that the module runs without modifications? Can I check this simply by building a pypy-trunk, and write "import cmaxent"?</p></body></html>

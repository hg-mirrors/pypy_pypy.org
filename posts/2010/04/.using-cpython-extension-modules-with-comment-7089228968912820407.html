<html><body><b>@holger</b><br><i>some discussion and web page regarding rpy-ext/ctypes/cpy-ext would make sense</i><br><br>Yes, someone could write down guidelines. Using the C API runs your module fast in case of CPython. A bit slower on ironpython and PyPy.<br><br>Using ctypes gives your module access to these three interpreters as well, but it will run slower. One advantage here is that you do not need to write C to create a wrapper around a library. If your objective is speed and lower memory usage, then CTypes does not work either.<br><br>Mixed modules make your module work only on PyPy and provide a decent speed and a mixture of a decent (Python) and a bit harder to grasp (RPython) programming language. This only makes sense as a platform if your users are also using PyPy.</body></html>

Early comments mentioned that nobody had tried numpy or scipy yet -- has that changed?<br><br>Also, does this make the multiprocessing library available? Or, is pp (parallel processing) available? <br><br>I'm very excited about PyPy because of the JIT. But for my work I also need some form of utilizing multiple CPU's. Right now I'm using unladen swallow with the multiprocessing module.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>Actually, hashlib.sha was not the same as sha.sha: the former used to be a ctypes call to the OpenSSL lib, whereas the latter uses our built-in sha implementation.  So hashlib.sha was faster in theory, but killed by the overhead of using ctypes.  Now, at least in a default version of pypy, the hashlib.md5 and .sha are redirected to the built-in md5.md5 and sha.sha.<br><br>Another issue was that with the built-in md5.md5 and sha.sha, on 64-bit, there was a 1.5x speed impact due to the C compiler not recognizing an expression that was meant to be a 32-bit integer rotation.<br><br>I guess that http://speed.pypy.org don't show this because they use directly md5.md5 or sha.sha, and are on 32-bit.</p></body></html>

<p>The <a href="http://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/extradoc/sprintinfo/leysin-winter-2011/announcement.txt">next sprint</a> will be in Leysin, Switzerland, during the week of the 16th-22nd of January 2011.</p>

<p>Now that we have released 1.4, and plan to release 1.4.1 soon, the sprint is going to be mainly working on fixing issues reported by various users.  Of course this does not prevent people from showing up with a more precise interest in mind.</p>

<p>As usual, the break day on the sprint will likely be a day of skiing :-)</p>

<p>Hoping to see you there.</p>

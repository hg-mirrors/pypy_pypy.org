<html><body><p>I'm very impressed with what you've all achieved!<br><br>I've been testing PyPy 1.4 with some code I'm working on which only depends on two pure-Python non-stdlib libraries, and although the result was a 50% longer running time than with Python 2.5, it's remarkable that the code behaves in the same way and produces the same results. When trying to produce a fully compatible implementation of something, it's no trivial task to get identical behaviour (even though I'm not really using "exotic" or "frivolous" language features): some corner case usually comes along and makes things difficult. To see a non-trivial example work just like "normal Python" is surely evidence that PyPy is ready for a wider audience.<br><br>As for my code, I've been doing some profiling generally - it uses things like the array and bisect modules substantially - and will attempt to see how profile-directed improvements affect PyPy's performance.<br><br>Keep up the good work!</p></body></html>

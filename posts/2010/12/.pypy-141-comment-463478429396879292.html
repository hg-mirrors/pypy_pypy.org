<html><body><p>Andrei: not directly.  We played at some point with translating RPython code to Javascript, but it didn't give enough benefits (because it's not full Python that we can translate, just "RPython").  The alternative would be to translate the whole PyPy interpreter to Javascript, but that would give a result that is both huge (in term of download size) and horribly slow (100x slower than Javascript maybe).</p></body></html>

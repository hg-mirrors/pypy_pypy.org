<html><body><p>Inspired by some of the comments to the release that said "You are heroes", I though a bit about the longish history of PyPy and hunted around for some of the mailing list posts that started the project. Then I put all this information together into the following timeline:</p>
<div id="content" style="height: 550px;">
   <a href="http://cfbolz.de/timeline.html">timeline</a> 
</div>
<p>There is also a <a href="http://cfbolz.de/pypy-timeline/timeline.html">larger version of the timeline</a>. Try to click on some of the events, the links usually go to the sprint descriptions. I also tried to find pictures for the sprints but succeeded for only half of them, if anybody still has some, I would be interested. It's kind of fun to browse around in some of the old sprint descriptions to see how PyPy evolved. Some of the current ideas have been around for a long time, some are new. In the description of the releases I put estimates for the speed of the release.</p></body></html>

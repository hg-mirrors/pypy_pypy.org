<html><body><p>There are still a number of branches that have not been merged into trunk yet: at least fast-forward (Python 2.7), jit-unroll-loops (better JITting of arithmetic and short loops), arm-backend (JIT support on ARM) and jitypes2 (turn ctypes calls into real assembler-level calls with the JIT).  There is also the stackless+JIT integration pending.  Finally the sprint will also be a place to try out and run some applications.  So it's not like we are out of work :-)</p></body></html>

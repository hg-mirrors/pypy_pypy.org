<h3 class="title">PyPy joins the Software Freedom Conservancy</h3>

<p>Good news. PyPy is now a member of the Software Freedom Conservancy (SFC),
see <a class="reference external" href="http://sfconservancy.org/news/2010/nov/10/pypy-joins/">the SFC blog post</a>.  This allows us to manage non-profit monetary aspects of
the project independently from a company or particular persons.   So we
can now officially receive donations both from people prefering right or
left sides, see the <tt class="docutils literal">Donate</tt> buttons on our <a class="reference external" href="http://pypy.org/">home page</a> and our <a class="reference external" href="http://morepypy.blogspot.com/">blog</a>.
And you can use PayPal or Google Checkout, Donations are tax-exempt in the
USA and hopefully soon in Europe as well.</p>
<p>What's it going to get used for?  For the immediate future we intend to use
the donations for funding travels of core contributors to PyPy sprints
who otherwise can't afford to come.  So if you have no time but some
money you can help to encourage coding contributors to care for PyPy.
If we end up with bigger sums we'll see and take suggestions.  Money
spending decisions will be done by core PyPy people according to
non-profit guidelines.  And we'll post information from time to time
about how much we got and where the money went.</p>
<p>If you have any questions regarding the SFC membership or donations
you may send email to sfc at pypy.org  which will be observed
by Carl Friedrich Bolz, Jacob Hallen and Holger Krekel - the initial
PyPy SFC representatives on behalf of the PyPy team.  Many thanks go
out to Bradley M. Kuhn for helping to implement the PyPy SFC membership.</p>
<p>cheers,</p>
<p>Holger &amp; Carl Friedrich</p>

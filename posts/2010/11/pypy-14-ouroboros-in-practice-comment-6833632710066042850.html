<html><body><p>Congrats to all PyPy developers for making huge contributions to Python performance, JIT and implementation research and delivering an end product that will help many developers to get more done.<br><br>IIUC, we still have ARM, jit-unroll-loops, more memory improvements, Python 2.7 (Fast Forward branch) and a bunch of other cool improvements in the works, besides some known interesting targets that will eventually be tackled (e.g. JITted stackless).<br><br>I wish more big Python apps and developers would play with PyPy and report the results.<br><br>Cheers!<br><br>P.S.: Fijal: see <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/3851#comment-57715" rel="nofollow">http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/3851#comment-57715</a></p></body></html>

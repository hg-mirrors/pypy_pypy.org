<html><body><p>Heh, I don't remember that :-)<br><br>Anyway, LuaJIT has more options for microoptimziations simply because Lua is a simpler language. That doesn't actually make it impossible for PyPy, it simply make it harder and taking more time (but it's still possible). I still think we can get (but predicting future is hard) where LuaJIT is right now, but racing Mike would be a challenge that we might loose ;-)<br><br>That said, even in simple loops there are obvious optimizations to be performed, so we're far from being done. We're going there, but it's taking time ;-)</p></body></html>

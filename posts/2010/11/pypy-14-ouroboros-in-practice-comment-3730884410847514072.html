<html><body><p>This is awesome. PyPy 1.4 addresses the 2 slowest benchmarks, slowspitfire and spambayes. There is no benchmark anymore where PyPy is much slower than CPython.<br><br>To me, this marks the first time you can say that PyPy is ready for general "consumption". Congratulations!<br><br>PS: The best comparison to appreciate how much of an improvement 1.4 has been is:<br>http://speed.pypy.org/comparison/?exe=2%2B35,1%2B41,1%2B172&amp;ben=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20&amp;env=1&amp;hor=false&amp;bas=2%2B35&amp;chart=normal+bars</p></body></html>

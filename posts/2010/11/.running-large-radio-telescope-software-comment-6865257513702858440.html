<html><body><p>Hi Maciej,<br><br>You say that there you are mostly using Python and sometimes C, CUDA or FPGAs.<br>I am writing my master thesis in the Netherlands, it is about the efficient implementation of a beam forming algorithm (the one used by the LOFAR) on modern GPUs using CUDA and OpenCL. Do you have some papers or other material there about the telescope software ? I would be really interested on citing it on the related works part.</p></body></html>

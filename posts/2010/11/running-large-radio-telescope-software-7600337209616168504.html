<html><body><p>Hello.</p>
<p>As some of you already know, I've recently started working on a
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MeerKAT">very large radio telescope</a> at <a class="reference external" href="http://ska.ac.za">SKA South Africa</a>. This telescope's
operating software runs almost exclusively on Python (several high throughput
pieces are in C or CUDA or directly executed by FPGAs). Some cool telescope pictures:</p>

<p>Most of the operation software is using the <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/hodgestar/katcp">KatCP</a> protocol to talk between devices.
The currently used implementation is Open Source software with a custom home built
server and client. As part of the experiments, I've implemented a <a class="reference external" href="http://twistedmatrix.com">Twisted</a> based
version and run in on top of CPython and PyPy for both the default
implementation and the one based on Twisted to see how those perform.</p>
<p>There are two testing scenarios: the first one is trying to saturate the connection
by setting up multiple sensors that report state every 10ms, the second one
is measuring a round-trip between sending a request and receiving the response.
Both numbers are measuring the number of requests per 0.2s, so the more the better. On X axis there is a number of simultanously connected clients.</p>
<p>All benchmark code is available in the KatCP repository.</p>
<p>The results are as follows:</p>

<p>As you can see, in general Twisted has larger overhead for a single client
and scales better as the number of clients increases. That's I think expected,
since Twisted has extra layers of indirection. The round trip degradation of
Twisted has to be investigated, but for us scenario1 is by far more important.</p>
<p>All across the board PyPy performs much better than CPython for both
Twisted and a home-made solution, which I think is a pretty good result.</p>
<p>Note: we didn't roll this set up into production yet, but there are high
chances for both twisted and PyPy to be used in some near future.</p>

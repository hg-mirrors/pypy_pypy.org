<html><body><p>Hey.<br><br>spitfire and slowspitfire are a 'won't fix' benchmarks (at least in the near future). The spitfire_cstringio is using the same thing, but cStringIO instead of a list of strings.<br><br>Twisted_tcp is slightly more complex and has something to do with pushing a lot of data through sockets. In pypy you usually have to copy data before write, because it can potentially be moved in the GC.<br><br>Cheers,<br>fijal</p></body></html>

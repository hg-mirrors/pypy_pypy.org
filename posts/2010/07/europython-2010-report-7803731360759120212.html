<html><body><p>So, EuroPython 2010 is over, I am flying home and it's time to write a report
about the conference from the PyPy point of view.</p>
<p>As usual, the conference was very interesting and went very well. The quality
of the talks I attended to was high on average and most importantly I could
meet a lot of interesting people to discuss various things.</p>
<p>On the first day, Armin, Amaury and I presented the usual <a class="reference external" href="http://www.europython.eu/talks/talk_abstracts/index.html#talk124">PyPy status talk</a>
(here are the <a class="reference external" href="http://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/extradoc/talk/ep2010/talk/talk.pdf">slides</a>):
the talk is an extended version of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pycon.it/conference/talks/pypy-12-snakes-never-crawled-so-fast">the one</a> that I and Armin presented at
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.pycon.it">Pycon Italia</a> in May and is divided in three parts: first I talked about the
current status of the project, what is the content of the recent 1.2 and 1.3
releases and showed a <a class="reference external" href="http://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/extradoc/talk/ep2010/pypy_demo/">demo</a> of a simple Django application that renders a
Mandelbrot fractal and is measurably faster on PyPy than on CPython.  In the
second part of the talk, Armin gave an introduction about the ideas that stand
behind the JIT.  Finally, in the third part Amaury explained how the new
<a class="reference external" href="http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2010/04/using-cpython-extension-modules-with.html">cpyext</a> module lets PyPy to compile and load existing CPython extensions
written in C.</p>
<p>I think that the talk was well received: the only drawback is that there was
no time to answer questions at the end of the presentation.  However, we
received a lot of "offline" questions after the talk finished and thorough the
whole conference: it is always great to see that people are interested in our
work, and I'd like to thank everybody for the feedback that they gave to us.</p>
<p>PyPy was also mentioned in the interesting <a class="reference external" href="http://www.europython.eu/talks/talk_abstracts/index.html#talk40">Mark Shannon's talk</a>, where he
compared the optimization techniques used by PyPy, <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/unladen-swallow/">Unladen Swallow</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/hotpy/">HotPy</a>, which is Mark's own PhD project.  Moreover, Henrik Vendelbo
gave a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.europython.eu/talks/talk_abstracts/index.html#talk117">talk about how to tweak PyPy</a> to produce a standalone
executable which embeds a whole python application to make deployment easier,
while Andrew Francis explained his implementation of the Go <a class="reference external" href="http://www.europython.eu/talks/talk_abstracts/index.html#talk117">select
statement</a> based on the <tt class="docutils literal">stackless.py</tt> module implemented in PyPy.  Personally,
I am glad to see that people start to think of PyPy as a useful starting
point to experiment with new features and use cases that we did not think
about: after all, one of PyPy explicit goals is to be <a class="reference external" href="http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/getting-started.html#id3">"flexible and easy to
experiment with"</a>.</p>
<p>After the conference there were the usual <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.europython.eu/Sprints">post EuroPython sprints</a>: this
year we had not planned a PyPy sprint, but some people showed interest
in it and since Armin and I happened to be still around the day after the
conference, we decided to do a mini 1-day sprint, with 6 or 7 people
present. Since there were only two core developers it was impossible to use
our usual pairing scheme, in which every newcomer pairs with someone who is
experienced with the source code to gain knowledge of it.  However, I think it
was still a successful day of work, and we managed to fix a couple of bugs
that was standing in our issue tracker.  Again, I'd like to thank all the
people that came and worked with us during the sprint.</p>
<p>In conclusion I really enjoyed the EuroPython 2010 experience: the fact that I
managed to find a place in Birmingham where to eat a good Italian-style "gelato"
helped a lot :-).</p></body></html>

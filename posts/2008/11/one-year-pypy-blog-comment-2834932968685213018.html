I actually have a vague plan to give a basic introduction of the ideas behind the JIT (but will still take some time, I am busy with the lecture at the moment).<br><br>About more summaries of what happens: it requires a lot of discipline (see the Python-dev summaries) and I am not sure we have that :-).

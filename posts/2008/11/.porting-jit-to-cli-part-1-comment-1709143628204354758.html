<html><body><p>hi, thanks for your valuable comments.<br><br>Some notes:<br><br>  - I know about cpufreq-set, but even setting the governor to performance doesn't help, the timings vary a lot between different runs. If someone knows a way to run reliable benchmarks, it would be very appreciated!<br><br>  - I have plans to experiment also the JIT on the JVM: since HotSpot usually does a better job than CLR's JIT, it's possible/likely that the JVM is a better platform for our purposes. Also, the experimental Da Vinci Machine contains features that could be very useful for us.  Unfortunately the PyPy non-JIT JVM backend is not as advanced as the CLI one, and it lacks some features that are really needed for writing a JIT backend.<br><br>  - Float operations are already (mostly) supported by our JIT backends; I bet that if you add a FloatObj to the tlc interpreter, you will see huge speedups as well.  However, the real point of PyPy's approach is that once finished it will optimize much more than ints and floats, including features that are currently not implemented by psyco (e.g. generators).</p></body></html>

Otherwise you end up with someone filling in progress reports because they feel obliged to, rather than to celebrate new features, and it becomes a chore.<br><br>That said, PyPy has many subprojects; maybe having a round-robin system where we get a progress report from a different project every week would be interesting.</p></body></html>

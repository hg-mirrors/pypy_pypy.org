<html><body><p>What does the flexswitch compile into?  I'm guessing it would look like<br><br>    t = type(obj);<br>    if (t == int)<br>        ...<br>    else if (t == float)<br>        ...<br>    else<br>        ....<br><br>but maybe there's a better way (or maybe the answer is backend-dependent).</p></body></html>

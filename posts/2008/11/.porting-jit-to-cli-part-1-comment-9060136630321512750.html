<html><body><p>If you are benchmarking on Linux then watch out for CPU speed scaling.  For example on Ubuntu by default the ondemand governor is used which runs the CPU at lowest possible speed and until there is any CPU demand at which point it runs at fastest.  The time to switch varies (eg sometimes it can be instantaneous, other times a second or two, and other times not at all).<br><br>Make sure to use:  cpufreq-set -g performance<br><br>That will run at maximum CPU speed the whole time.</p></body></html>

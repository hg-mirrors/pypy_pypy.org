<html><body><p>Last Friday the PyPy Status Blog had its first anniversary. Yay! After not
really buying into any of this new-fangled "blog" stuff for a long time we just
bit the bullet and got started. Totally surprisingly it even worked. We posted
76 post in the last year, more than one per week. By now we have more than 800
subscribers (according to feedburner), which is quite cool for a rather niche
blog.</p>
<p>To make our blog even more interesting, I would like to ask for some feedback
via the comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Which posts did you like in particular?</li>
<li>What sort of posts would you be interested in getting more of?</li>
<li>Any other improvements we could make?</li>
</ul>

<html><body><p>Hi all,</p>

<p>A few command-line options for translate.py have changed.
Most interesting is that optimization levels are selected with
the option --opt, or -O for short.  This replaces --allopts,
which was also called --faassen in reference to a person who
is actually not involved in PyPy (so that was a bit of a
strange joke).  Also, --allworkingmodules is the default
nowadays, and can be cancelled with --no-allworkingmodules.
Threads are also included in --allworkingmodules now.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p></p><ul><li><b>translate.py</b> (reasonable default, corresponds to --opt=2)
    </li><li><b>translate.py --opt=3</b> (best, maybe 10-20% faster)
    </li><li><b>translate.py --opt=1</b> (translation is faster and less RAM-hungry)
</li></ul>

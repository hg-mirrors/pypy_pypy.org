<html><body><p>maybe for a bit of background: Martijn Faassen regularly asked at our talks "how fast is PyPy now?" - at times when PyPy was going from 2000 to 500 to 50 to ???? times slower than CPython (nowadays at 1-6 times, btw).  so with "--faassen" we were trying to translate an "as-fast-as-possible" pypy.  so now we are getting dead serious (also Martijn actually asked for removing his name from the commandline) and introduced a we-are-becoming-a-real-compiler-with-opt-levels "-O" option :)<br><br>Martijn, to be clear: i really appreciate having you and your questions in our talks and in general - it also pushed me to get out py.test releases ... :) holger</p></body></html>

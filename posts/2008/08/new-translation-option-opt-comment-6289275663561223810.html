<html><body><p>Congrats to PyPy on having a more sensible option! (though an option called 'opt' made me think it stood for 'option' first :).<br><br>Thanks Holger for the background. "actually not involved in PyPy" depends on your interpretation of what the word "involved" means. Besides performance related questions, as Holger indicates I've asked other questions of the PyPy project too. I wasn't altogether successful at it (nor altogether unsuccessful), and I'm on an extended break from asking any questions right now.<br><br>I didn't write any of the PyPy code and also had nothing to do with the design of PyPy. I indeed asked for the --faassen option to be removed earlier this year. It was amusing (and flattering), but it also lead to some confusion concerning credit that I certainly don't deserve - that goes to the PyPy developers and project managers.</p></body></html>

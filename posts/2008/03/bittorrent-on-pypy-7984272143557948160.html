<html><body><p>Hi all,</p>

<p>Bittorrent now runs on PyPy! I tried the no-GUI BitTornado version (btdownloadheadless.py). It behaves correctly and I fixed the last few obvious places which made noticeable pauses.  (However we know that there are I/O performance issues left: we make too many internal copies of the data, e.g. in a <code>file.read()</code> or <code>os.read()</code>.)</p>

<p>We are interested in people trying out other real-world applications that, like the GUI-less Bittorrent, don't have many external dependencies to C extension modules. Please report all the issues to us!</p>

<p>The current magic command line for creating a <code>pypy-c</code> executable with as many of CPython's modules as possible is:</p>

<pre>
  cd pypy/translator/goal
  ./translate.py --thread targetpypystandalone.py --allworkingmodules --withmod-_rawffi --faassen
</pre>

<p>(This gives you a thread-aware <code>pypy-c</code>, which requires the Boehm gc library.  The _rawffi module gives you ctypes support but is only tested for Linux at the moment.)</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>As in the last years, PyPy will again participate in Google's Summer of Code
program under the umbrella of the Python Software Foundation. Unfortunately we
were a bit disorganized this year, so that our project ideas are only put up
now. The list of project ideas of PyPy can be found <a class="reference" href="http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/project-ideas.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Any interested student should mail to our <a class="reference" href="http://codespeak.net/mailman/listinfo/pypy-dev">mailing list</a> or just come to the
#pypy channel on irc.freenode.net to discuss things.</p></body></html>

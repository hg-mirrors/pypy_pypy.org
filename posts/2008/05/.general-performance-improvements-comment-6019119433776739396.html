<html><body><p>Note that current benchmarks suggest that CPython 3.0 is yet much slower than CPython 2.x. It might be interesting to see whether this means that PyPy is much faster than CPython 3.0 running e.g. Pystone. <br>Of course this fact would not be very surprising, esp. given that PyPy does not implement any CPy3k features.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>Great work!<br><br>I have a few questions not answered by the FAQ that I hope someone will be able to answer.<br><br>When might the JIT be ready enough? (no stress, just asking :)<br><br>How much faster are CPython 2.5, 2.6 and 3.0? That seems to be relevant to the statement "we now expect PyPy to be in the worst case twice as slow than CPython".<br><br>If I understand correctly, one of the purposes of PyPy is to make experimentation easier - so will making it compatible with 3.0 be fairly easy? Are there plans to do so?<br><br>Is PyPy expected to one day become a serious "competitor" to CPython, in that you might want to run it in production? Is there a time set for when it will be ready for use by the general public (i.e me ;)?</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>So, answering questions one by one:<br><br>JIT will be ready when it'll be ready, not earlier.<br><br>CPython 2.5 is slightly faster for some operations. No real difference there. 2.6 was optimized for certain operations, but as well, don't expect a huge difference. I think you can expect pypy to be in range of 2x for any cpython. 3.0 is not even sure how will look like, but certainly being ultra fast is not it's primary goal.<br><br>Regarding making pypy compatible with 3.0 - yes, that should be fairly easy although we don't have any immediate plans doing that.<br><br>The final date for making pypy production ready is not set (and this is a gradual process), but as you can see <a href="http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2008/03/bittorrent-on-pypy.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2008/02/running-pyglet-on-pypy.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> we're trying more and more to make it run existing applications.<br><br>Cheers,<br>fijal</p></body></html>

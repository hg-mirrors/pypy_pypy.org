<html><body><p>Our next PyPy sprint will take place in the crashed <a href="http://www.c-base.org/">c-base space station</a>, Berlin, Germany, Earth, Solar System.  This is a fully public sprint: newcomers (from all planets) are welcome.  Suggestion of topics (other topics are welcome too):</p>

<ul>
<li>work on PyPy's JIT generator: we are refactoring parts of the
    compiling logic, in ways that may also allow generating better
    machine code for loops (people or aliens with knowledge on
    compilers and SSA, welcome)

</li><li>work on the SPy VM, PyPy's Squeak implementation, particularly the
    graphics capabilities                                             

</li><li>work on PyPy's GameBoy emulator, which also needs graphics support
                                                                      
</li><li>trying some large pure-Python applications or libraries on PyPy and
    fixing the resulting bugs. Possibilities are Zope 3, Django and
    others.
</li></ul>

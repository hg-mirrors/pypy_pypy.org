<html><body><p>pyprocessing has it's own problems (not that threads has no problems at all :)<br><br>1. Memory usage, you need basically n times more memory when n is number of processes<br><br>2. you cannot pass arbitrary data between processes, just stuff that you can marshal/pickle which is a bit huge limitation.<br><br>3. on the other hand, multiple processes provides you better control, although not via threading drop-in replacement.<br><br>Cheers,<br>fijal</p></body></html>

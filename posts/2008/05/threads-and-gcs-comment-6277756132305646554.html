<html><body><p>In response to maciej, OSes that implement copy-on-write fork (Linux, but not Windows, unsure about Mac OS X), don't take n times more memory.  Fine-grained locking and an OpenMP-like syntax would be potentially useful.  Maybe you could get a student to prototype these for you.  But I'm sure someone will find a way to parallelize Python eventually, or we'll all switch to some other language, as the number of cores goes to infinity.</p></body></html>

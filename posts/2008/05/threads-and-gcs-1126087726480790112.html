<html><body><p>Hi all,</p>

<p>We can now compile a pypy-c that includes both thread support
and one of our semi-advanced garbage collectors.  This means
that threaded Python programs can now run not only with a
better performance, but without the annoyances of the Boehm
garbage collector.  (For example, Boehm doesn't like too much
seeing large numbers of __del__(), and our implementation of
ctypes uses them everywhere.)</p>

<p>Magic translation command (example):</p>

<p></p><pre>   translate.py --thread --gc=hybrid targetpypystandalone --faassen --allworkingmodules</pre>

<p>Note that multithreading in PyPy is based on a global
interpreter lock, as in CPython.  I imagine that we will get
rid of the global interpreter lock at some point in the future
-- I can certainly see how this might be done in PyPy, unlike
in CPython -- but it will be a lot of work nevertheless.  Given
our current priorities, it will probably not occur soon unless
someone steps in.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>By using fine-grained locking: locking every dictionary and list while it is used.  This is what Jython does (or more precisely, what Jython asks the JVM to do for it).  This certainly comes with a performance penalty, so it would only pay off if you actually have and can use multiple CPUs -- which is fine in PyPy: you would just translate different pypy-c's depending on the use case.<br><br>This would be a pain to implement in CPython, in particular because of refcounting.  Even if the Py_INCREF and Py_DECREF macros were made thread-safe, all C-level APIs that manipulate borrowed references might have to be redesigned.</p></body></html>

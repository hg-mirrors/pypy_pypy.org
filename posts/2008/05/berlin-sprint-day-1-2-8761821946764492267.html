<html><body><p>After having survived the S3-Workshop which took place in Potsdam on Thursday
and Friday (a blog-post about this will follow later) we are now sitting in the
c-base in Berlin, happily sprinting. Below are some notes on what progress we
made so far:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The Gameboy emulator in RPython that Camillo Bruni is working on for his
Bachelor project at Uni Bern does now translate. It took him (assisted by
various people) a while to figure out the translation errors (essentially
because he wrote nice Python code that passed bound methods around, which the
RTyper doesn't completely like).  Now that is fixed and the Gameboy emulator
translates and runs a test ROM.  You cannot really see anything yet, because
there is no graphics support in RPython.</li>
<li>To get graphics support in RPython Armin and Karl started writing SDL
bindings for RPython, which both the Gameboy emulator and the SPy VM need.
They have basic stuff working, probably enough to support the Gameboy
already.</li>
<li>Alexander, Armin, Maciek and Samuele discussed how to approach separate
compilation for RPython, which isn't easy because the RPython type analysis
is a whole-program analysis.</li>
<li>Stephan, Peter and Adrian (at least in the beginning) worked on making PyPy's
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stackless</span></tt> module more complete. They added channel preferences which
change details of the scheduling semantics.</li>
<li>Toon, Carl Friedrich and Adrian (a tiny bit) worked on SPy. There is a branch
that Toon started a while ago which contains many improvements but is also
quite unclear in many respects. There was some progress in cleaning that up.
This involved implementing the Smalltalk process scheduler (Smalltalk really
is an OS). There is still quite some work left though. While doing so, we
discovered many funny facts about Squeak's implementation details (most of
which are exposed to the user) in the process. I guess we should collect them
and blog about them eventually.</li>
<li>Samuele and Maciek improved the ctypes version of pysqlite that Gerhard
HÃ¤ring started.</li>
<li>Armin, Samuele and Maciek found an obscure bug in the interaction between the
builtin-type-shortcut that Armin recently implemented and our multimethod
implementation. It's not clear which of the two are to blame, however it
seems rather unclear how to fix the problem: Armin and Samuele are stuck in a
discussion about how to approach a solution since a while and are hard to
talk to.</li>
<li>Stijn Timbermont, a Ph.D. student at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel who is
visiting the sprint for two days was first looking at how our GCs are
implemented to figure out whether he can use PyPy for some experiments. The
answer to that seems to be no. Today he was hacking on a Pico interpreter
(without knowing too much about Python) and is making some nice progress, it
seems.</li>
</ul>

<p>Will try to blog more as the sprint progresses.</p></body></html>

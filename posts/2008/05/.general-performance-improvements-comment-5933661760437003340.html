<html><body><p>There are actually two dictionaries, at least when using one of the generational GCs: one for the first generation objects and one for the rest.  The dictionary for the rest of the objects can probably get quite large, but it needs to be traversed once during each full collection only.  It seems that full collections are rare enough: the full dictionary updating doesn't stand out in profiled runs.<br><br>I didn't think about implementing id() at the language level, e.g. by extending the class of the object to add a field. <br>We can't really do that in RPython.  Moreover, that seems impractical for Python: if someone asks for the id() of an integer object, do all integers suddenly need to grow an 'id' field?</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>Recently, thanks to Amaury Forgeot d'Arc and Michael Schneider, Windows became more of a first-class platform for PyPy's Python interpreter. Most RPython extension modules are now considered <a href="http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/config/objspace.allworkingmodules.html">working</a> (apart from some POSIX specific modules). Even CTypes now works on windows!
<br>
<br>
Next step would be to have better <a href="http://pypy.intarweb.us/">buildbot</a> support for all supported platforms (Windows, Linux and OS X), so we can control and react to regressions quickly. (Buildbot is maintained by <a href="http://jcalderone.livejournal.com/">JP Calderone</a>)

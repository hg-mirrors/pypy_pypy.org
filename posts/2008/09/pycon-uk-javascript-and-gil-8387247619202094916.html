<html><body><p>Just got back from <a href="http://www.pyconuk.org/">Pycon UK 2008</a> - here are some impressions. <br><br>
Both the keynote speakers Mark Shuttleworth (Canonical) and 
Ted Leung (Sun Microsystems) expressed their concerns about
Javascript becoming so fast and prominent that it could displace
Python in the future.  They also highlighted the fact that
Multi-core systems get cheaper and more popular also on 
desktop computers or notebooks.  They challenged the community
to advance Python implementations to exploit it.  Question was up 
what PyPy can do here.  As it stands, PyPy still uses the good old
Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) but our approaches should indeed 
lend itself well to do experimentation with free threading.  
<br><br>
During the 2-day conference we met many interesting people, most 
notably the guys from <a href="http://www.resolversystems.com/">Resolver</a>, among them William Reade who is working on
<a href="http://www.resolversystems.com/documentation/index.php/Ironclad">IronClad</a> -- which implements a fake python25.dll on top of
IronPython.  He presented some good results for <a href="http://numpy.scipy.org/">Numpy</a> in his
lightning talk.  This approach is surely something to follow
closely and potentially use for PyPy. 
<br><br>
We also had lunch and a couple of chats with Jacob Kaplan-Moss from
<a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> fame - he is apparently up to try use PyPy's <a href="http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/sandbox.html">sandboxing</a> features
for one of his projects, cool!
<br><br>
Conference itself was well organized for the 230 attending people - although
the venue might be a bit small for next year's EuroPython.  Ah, and
we gave three well attended talks, find the slides here:

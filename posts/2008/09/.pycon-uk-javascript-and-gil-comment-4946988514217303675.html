<html><body><p>colin: true, jython and also ironpython can make use of multiple threads.  should have mentioned it.  Doesn't mean that pypy-c shouldn't go for it, rather the opposite i'd think :)  <br><br>renel/multiprocessing module: i can imagine it helps with multi-core cpus.  are there practical experiences using it yet? <br><br>luis, miguel: there are considerable efforts on the PyPy/JIT front - particularly from Armin, Carl Friedrich and Antonio - would be worth a dedicated blog post to relate this to tracing JITs, V8, squirrelfish, etc.  One thing i know is that we probably want to apply for funding to help completing the JIT. <br> <br>Miguel: We do have advanced GCs and are working on on improving them, currently. <br><br>to all: thanks for your feedback!</p></body></html>

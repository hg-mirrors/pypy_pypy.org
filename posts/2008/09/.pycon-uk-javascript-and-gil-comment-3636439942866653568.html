It tries to mimic the threading API.<br>If you use multiple processes instead of threads you will avoid the Global Interpreter Lock.<br><br>About new chalenges for PyPy, multicore isn't the major problem.. the absense of a powerfull JIT and GC is. Please keep working on a super-fast "VM+JIT" for python! (super linux performance is a must)</p></body></html>

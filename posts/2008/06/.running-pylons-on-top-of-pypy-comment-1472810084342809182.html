<html><body><p>PJE: What you say is mostly beside the point. PyPy has no problem at all with non-string keys in (old-style) class dicts. The point is more that locals() cannot be used to assign things to this dictionary, see <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/built-in-funcs.html" rel="nofollow">the docs</a>:<br><br>"<b>locals()</b><br>    Update and return a dictionary representing the current local symbol table. Warning: The contents of this dictionary should not be modified; changes may not affect the values of local variables used by the interpreter."</p></body></html>

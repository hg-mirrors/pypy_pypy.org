<html><body><p>As PyPy is getting more and more usable, we need better tools to use to work on certain applications running on top of PyPy. Out of this interest, I spent some time implementing the <b>_lsprof</b> module, which is a part of the standard library since Python2.5. It is necessary for the <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-profile.html">cProfile</a> module, which can profile Python programs with high accuracy and a lot less overhead than the older, pure-python <b>profile</b> module. Together with the excellent
<a href="http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/tool/lsprofcalltree.py">lsprofcalltree</a> script, you can display this data using <a href="http://kcachegrind.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/show.cgi">kcachegrind</a>, which gives you great visualization possibilities for your profile data.

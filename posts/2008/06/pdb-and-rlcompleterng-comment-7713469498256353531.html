<html><body><p>That's pretty impressive, but I think having to modify readline itself in order to do this is a little excessive. readline's completion capabilities are pretty limited. I wonder if there are any better alternatives that could be used with Python.<br><br>I have something similar set up for my Python prompt: http://bitheap.org/hg/dotfiles/file/tip/.pythonrc.py -- it allows completion and indentation, it persists command history with readline, and it prints documentation if you try to evaluate certain objects like functions, classes, and methods. It also pretty-prints output, but I'm still trying to tweak it so it's aware of the terminal width.</p></body></html>

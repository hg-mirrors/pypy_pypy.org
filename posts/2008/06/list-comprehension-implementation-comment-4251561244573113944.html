<html><body><p>The code's not overly clever, it's ridiculous, because it exactly duplicates the effects of not having __all__ at all. From foo import * already won't import names prefaced with an underscore. Also from the google code search it looks like it's mostly used in Paste, most of the other hits are false positives.<br><br>The "from foo import *" case (without __all__ defined) is a good enough reason to match the cpython naming, though, the useless code in Paste not withstanding.</p></body></html>

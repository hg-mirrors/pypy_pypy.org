<html><body><p>Hi Martijn, <br><br>in fact having zope3 work with pypy would be very nice.  i discussed a bit with Phillip and he suggested to first get zope.interface and zope.component to work, then zope.proxy/zope.security.  IIRC my first try with zope.interface yielded 3 failures out of 231 tests.  I had to hack the test runner a bit to not rely on GC details - i guess that your work for Jython might imply that as well.  What is the best way to follow your Jython work, btw?<br><br>best &amp; cheers, <br>holger</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>List comprehensions are a nice feature in Python. They are, however, just
syntactic sugar for <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">for</span></tt> loops. E.g. the following list comprehension:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def f(l):
    return [i ** 2 for i in l if i % 3 == 0]
</pre>
<p>is sugar for the following <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">for</span></tt> loop:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def f(l):
    result = []
    for i in l:
        if i % 3 == 0:
            result.append(i ** 2)
    return result
</pre>
<p>The interesting bit about this is that list comprehensions are actually
implemented in almost exactly this way. If one disassembles the two functions
above one gets sort of similar bytecode for both (apart from some details, like
the fact that the append in the list comprehension is done with a special
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">LIST_APPEND</span></tt> bytecode).</p>
<p>Now, when doing this sort of expansion there are some classical problems: what
name should the intermediate list get that is being built? (I said classical
because this is indeed one of the problems of many macro systems). What CPython
does is give the list the name <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_[1]</span></tt> (and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_[2]</span></tt>... with nested list
comprehensions). You can observe this behaviour with the following code:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ python
Python 2.5.2 (r252:60911, Apr 21 2008, 11:12:42)
[GCC 4.2.3 (Ubuntu 4.2.3-2ubuntu7)] on linux2

&gt;&gt;&gt; [dir() for i in [0]][0]
['_[1]', '__builtins__', '__doc__', '__name__', 'i']
&gt;&gt;&gt; [[dir() for i in [0]][0] for j in [0]][0]
['_[1]', '_[2]', '__builtins__', '__doc__', '__name__', 'i', 'j']
</pre>
<p>That is a sort of nice decision, since you can not reach that name by any
"normal" means. Of course you can confuse yourself in funny ways if you want:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; [locals()['_[1]'].extend([i, i + 1]) for i in range(10)]
[0, 1, None, 1, 2, None, 2, 3, None, 3, 4, None, 4, 5, None, 5, 6, None, 6, 7, None, 7, 8, None, 8, 9, None, 9, 10, None]
</pre>
<p>Now to the real reason why I am writing this blog post. PyPy's Python
interpreter implements list comprehensions in more or less exactly the same way,
with on tiny difference: the name of the variable:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ pypy-c-53594-generation-allworking
Python 2.4.1 (pypy 1.0.0 build 53594) on linux2

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [dir() for i in [0]][0]
['$list0', '__builtins__', '__doc__', '__name__', 'i']
</pre>
<!-- ::
][)())`` hack -->
<p>Now, that shouldn't really matter for anybody, should it? Turns out it does. The
following way too clever code is <a class="reference" href="http://www.google.com/codesearch?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=__name%5C+for%5C+__name%5C+in%5C+locals&amp;sbtn=Search">apparently used a lot</a>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
__all__ = [__name for __name in locals().keys() if not __name.startswith('_') '
               or __name == '_']
</pre>
<p>In PyPy this will give you a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">"$list0"</span></tt> in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__all__</span></tt>, which will prevent the
import of that module :-(. I guess I need to change the name to match CPython's.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson learned</strong>: no detail is obscure enough to not have some code depending
on it. Mostly problems on this level of obscurity are the things we are fixing
in PyPy at the moment.</p></body></html>

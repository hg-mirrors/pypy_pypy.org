<html><body><p>dsm: This is a two-level approach, corresponding to two levels of optimisations that are useful for dynamic languages like Python: the "high level" is the unboxing and dispatching removing that I describe in the post (which by itself can give something like a factor 50-100 speed-up in the best cases).  Traditional "low level" optimisations can be performed on top of that, by optimising the generated code that comes out of the "high level" (and this could give another 2-4x speed-up, i.e. the same difference as between "gcc" and "gcc -O3").<br><br>In this Prolog experiment we are only focusing on how to get the high level optimisations.</p></body></html>

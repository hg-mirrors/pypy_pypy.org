<html><body><p>Shalabh: It's also important to note 3 big benefits of implementing a language in the language itself, or a subset thereof ("turtles all the way down").<br><br>(1) Debugging and testing tools for programs written in the language then (hopefully) also work for debugging and testing the language implementation with minimal (or no) modification.  This also HUGELY lowers the bar for ordinary users of the language to find and fix implementation bugs.  This isn't a fault of Prolog, but 99.99% of Python users won't touch a Prolog debugger with a 10-foot pole.<br><br>(2) The largest pool of people most interested in improving the language is presumably the expert heavy users of the language.  Forcing them to learn a new language and/or implement the language in a language outside their expertise is a large disadvatage.<br><br>(3) The difference between language builtins and user code is reduced.  Also, it forces certain powerful constructs to (at times) be exposed in the language when they might otherwise only be exposed in the implementation language.  Also, with "turtles all the way down", performance improvements in the language itself also often apply to the language builtins, which increases the benefit of improvements, which is important in the cost/benefit analysis for undertaking the performance improvements in the first place.  Having "turtles all the way down" make some optimizations worthwhile that otherwise would be too much trouble to implement.</p></body></html>

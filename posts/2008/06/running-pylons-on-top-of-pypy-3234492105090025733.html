<html><body><p>The next episode of the "Running Real Applications on Top of PyPy" series: <br><br>
Yesterday, we spend some time with <a href="http://dunderboss.blogspot.com/">Philip Jenvey</a> on tweaking Pylons and PyPy to cooperate with each other. While doing this we found some pretty <a href="http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2008/06/list-comprehension-implementation.html">obscure details</a>, but in general things went well.
<br><br>
After resolving some issues, we can now run all (72) Pylons tests on
top of pypy-c compiled with the following command:
<br><br>
</p><div><code>
translate.py --gc=hybrid --thread targetpypystandalone --faassen --allworkingmodules --oldstyle
</code></div><br>
and run some example application. Here is the obligatory screenshot (of course
it might be fake, as usual with screenshots). Note: I broke application <b>on purpose</b> to showcase cool debugger, default screen is just boring:<br>

Please note that we run example application without DB access, since
we need some more work to get <a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a> run on top of pypy-c together with
pysqlite-ctypes. Just one example of an obscure details that sqlalchemy is
relying on in the test suite:
<br><br>
<code>
  class A(object):<br>
    locals()[42] = 98
</code>
<br><br>
<b>Update:</b>This is only about new-style classes.
<br><br>
This works on CPython and doesn't on PyPy.<br><br>
Cheers,<br>

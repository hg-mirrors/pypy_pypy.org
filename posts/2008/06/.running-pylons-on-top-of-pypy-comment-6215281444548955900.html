<html><body><p>Zope does things like:<br><br>frame = sys.getframe(1)<br>frame.f_locals['foo'] = bar<br><br>It does this to make zope.interface.implements() work, among other things. This allows you to the following:<br><br># IFoo is actually an instance, not a <br># class<br>class IFoo(zope.interface.Interface):<br>  pass<br><br>class Myclass:<br>  # stuffs information in the class<br>  zope.interface.implements(IFoo)<br><br>The <a href="http://pypy.python.org/pypy/martian" rel="nofollow">martian library</a> (which Grok uses) actually generates this into its directive construct.<br><br>Some of this stuff could become class decorators in the future, I imagine, but we're stuck supporting this future for the forseeable future as well.</p></body></html>

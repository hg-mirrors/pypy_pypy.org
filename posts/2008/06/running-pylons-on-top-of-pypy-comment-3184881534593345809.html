<html><body><p>Very good to see this work! This is a a good thing to be trying and hearing it makes me happy.<br><br>We're busy working on making Zope 3 run on Jython, which should get make some of our C level dependencies optional. These make a port to PyPy harder as well. Zope 3 libraries have umpteen thousands of tests that can be run, so that should give one some coverage. The libraries come packaged separately too. <br><br>The trickiest part would be those bits that depend on the ZODB. Porting the ZODB to PyPy should allow new possibilities, but it'll be hard too, I imagine.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>When hacking on PyPy, I spend a lot of time inside pdb; thus, I tried
to create a more comfortable environment where I can pass my nights
:-).</p>
<p>As a result, I wrote two modules:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference" href="http://codespeak.net/svn/user/antocuni/hack/pdb.py">pdb.py</a>, which extends the default behaviour of pdb, by adding
some commands and some fancy features such as syntax highlight and
powerful tab completion; pdb.py is meant to be placed somewhere in
your PYTHONPATH, in order to override the default version of pdb.py
shipped with the stdlib;</li>
<li><a class="reference" href="http://codespeak.net/svn/user/antocuni/hack/rlcompleter_ng.py">rlcompleter_ng.py</a>, whose most important feature is the ability
to show coloured completions depending on the type of the objects.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>To find more informations about those modules and how to install them,
have a look at their docstrings.</p>
<p>It's important to underline that these modules are not PyPy specific,
and they work perfectly also on top of CPython.</p>

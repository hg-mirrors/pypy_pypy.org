<html><body><p>PyPy got one proposal accepted for Google's <a class="reference" href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/">Summer of Code</a> under the Python
Software Foundation's umbrella.  We welcome <a class="reference" href="http://blog.brunogola.com.br/">Bruno Gola</a> into the PyPy
community. He will work on supporting all Python 2.5 features in PyPy and will
also update PyPy's standard library to support the modules that were modified
or new in Python 2.5.</p>
<p>Right now PyPy supports only Python 2.4 fully (some Python 2.5 features have
already sneaked in, though).</p></body></html>

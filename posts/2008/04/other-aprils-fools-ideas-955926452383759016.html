<html><body><p>While discussing what to post as an <a class="reference" href="http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2008/04/trying-to-get-pypy-to-run-on-python-30.html">April Fool's joke yesterday</a>, we had a
couple of other ideas, listed below. Most of them were rejected because they are
too incredible, others because they are too close to our wish list.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>quantum computer backend</li>
<li>Perl6 interpreter in RPython</li>
<li>Ruby backend to allow run "python on rails"</li>
<li>mandatory static typing at app-level, because it's the only way to increase
performances</li>
<li>rewrite PyPy in Haskell, because we discovered that dynamic typing is just
not suitable for a project of this size</li>
<li>a C front-end, so that we can <em>interpret</em> the C source of Python C extensions
and JIT it. This would work by writing an interpreter for LLVM bytecode in
RPython.</li>
<li>an elisp backend</li>
<li>a TeX backend (use PyPy for your advanced typesetting needs)</li>
<li>an SQL JIT backend, pushing remote procedures into the DB engine</li>
</ul></body></html>

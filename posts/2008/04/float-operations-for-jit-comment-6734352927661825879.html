<html><body><p>I'm interested in the choice of x87 as well. My understanding was that Intel (at least) was keeping x87 floating point around because of binary applications but that for single element floating point the SSE single-element instructions were the preferred option on any processor which supports SSE. (Unfortunately since they've got such different styles of programming I can understand if it's just that "older chips have to be supported, and we've only got enough programming manpower for 1 implementation".)</p></body></html>

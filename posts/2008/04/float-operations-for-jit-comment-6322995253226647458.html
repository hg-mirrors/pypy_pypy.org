We have no working LLVM JIT backend: although llvm advertizes supporting JIT compilation, what it really provides is a regular compiler packaged as a library that can be used at run-time.  This is only suitable for some kinds of usages; for example, it couldn't be used to write a Java VM with good just-in-time optimizations (which need e.g. quick and lazy code generation and regeneration, polymorphic inline caches, etc.)</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>During the EP2008 sprint we got <a href="http://pinax.hotcluboffrance.com/">Pinax</a> running on top of PyPy. At <a href="http://play1.pypy.org:7788">our play1 server we have it running on top of pypy-c</a>.  Not that you'll notice many differences to the original site but that's the point, isn't it? ... Well, in fact i am too lazy to customize our play1 version now - i rather spent a nice evening with the other sprint guys :) 

Pinax integrates numerous reusable <a href="http://djangoproject.com">Django</a> apps to take care of the things that many sites have in common. Many thanks particularly to Henrik Vendelbo who sorted out various Pinax and PyPy issues, and wrote up a nice <a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/DjangoAndPyPy">DjangoAndPyPy wiki page</a> describing the installation process.

greetings from Vilnius (Lithunia), Holger</p></body></html>

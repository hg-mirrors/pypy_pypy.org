<html><body><p>Last week I played a bit with <a class="reference" href="http://fusil.hachoir.org/trac">Fusil</a>, which is a <a class="reference" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzz_testing">fuzzing</a> framework.  The idea is
to feed the interpreter code that calls the functions of a module with random values
of various types as arguments in the hope that one hits an unchecked case. This is
done until a problem is hit , the most common problem being a segfault.  Victor Stinner,
the author of Fusil, is a regular in the PyPy IRC channel and thankfully helped me
getting started with Fusil. I used his project description for CPython as a starting
point and tweaked it a bit.  Reason is that PyPy is harder to segfault and so
I tweaked Fusil to also count uncaught RPython-level exceptions as such a problem.
(RPython has full exception support, and if an RPython-exception escapes to the top
level, the Python interpreter aborts.  One should not be able to exploit this but
but for a user it is bad enough, because such exceptions cannot be caught from
Python code.)</p>
<p>Using Fusil I found a number of cases where such exceptions happened (in some
pickle support-code, in the expat parser, in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">os</span></tt> and in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">termios</span></tt>
module) and also one or two segfaults (in the parser module, of all places).
I fixed all these problems so that by
now the fuzzer just runs for a very long time and only finds things that take
too long (so they count as a way to do a DoS attack) like
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pow(12355123123L,</span> <span class="pre">12351512123121L)</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">round(1,</span> <span class="pre">1000000000)</span></tt> (the latter
should probably be fixed). This probably just means that the fuzzer is not good
enough, because there are certainly segfaults left in PyPy. However, the fact
that it is rather hard to find them validates our approach of using a
high-level memory-managed language for our interpreter. Victor tells me that it
is rather easy to find segfaults in CPython this way, he already found <a class="reference" href="http://bugs.python.org/issue?%40search_text=&amp;title=&amp;%40columns=title&amp;id=&amp;%40columns=id&amp;creation=&amp;creator=haypo&amp;activity=2008-07-06&amp;%40columns=activity&amp;%40sort=activity&amp;actor=&amp;nosy=&amp;type=&amp;components=&amp;versions=&amp;dependencies=&amp;assignee=&amp;keywords=&amp;priority=&amp;%40group=priority&amp;status=1&amp;%40columns=status&amp;resolution=&amp;%40pagesize=50&amp;%40startwith=0&amp;%40queryname=&amp;%40old-queryname=&amp;%40action=search">quite

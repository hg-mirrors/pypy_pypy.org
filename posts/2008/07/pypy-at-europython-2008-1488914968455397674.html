<html><body><p>Greetings from Vilnius, Lithuania. There were already
two pypy talks, one performed by Jacob Hallen
<a href="http://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/extradoc/talk/ep2008/Pypy_for_the_rest_of_us.odp">PyPy for the rest of us</a> and second
by Maciej Fijalkowski <a href="http://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/extradoc/talk/ep2008/status.txt">PyPy status talk</a>. The thing that
we forgotten to tell is that PyPy sandboxing feature
can also easily limit CPU and RAM usage as well as
any other possible resource (like network transfer).
For anyone who would like to join, there is a PyPy
sprint after the conference.<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>

<html><body><p>Hello! I will have the pleasure of presenting PyPy on various conferences in the near future. They're (in chronological order):

</p><ul>
<li>Studencki Festiwal Informatyczny in Krakow, POLAND 6-8 March 2008. I think this might be only interesting for polish people (<a href="http://www.sfi.org.pl">website, in polish</a>)</li>

<li>Pycon Chicago, IL, USA. 14-17 March 2008. There should be also a PyPy sprint afterwards, including newbie-friendly tutorial, everybody is welcome to join us!  (Provided that I'll get the US visa, which seems to be non-trivial issue for a polish citizen)</li>
<li> RuPy, Poznan, POLAND 13-14 April 2008 (<a href="http://rupy.eu">website</a>). This is small, but very friendly Ruby and Python conference. Last year was amazing, I can strongly recommend to go there (Poznan is only 2h by train from Berlin also has its own airport).</li>
</ul>

Hope to see you at those places!<br><br>

Cheers,<br>

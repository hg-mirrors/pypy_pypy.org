<html><body><p>Continuing the <a class="reference" href="http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2008/02/python-finalizers-semantics-part-1.html">last blog post</a> about GC semantics in Python.</p>
<p>Another consequence of reference counting is that resurrection is easy to
detect. A dead object can resurrect itself if its finalizer stores it into a
globally reachable position, like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
class C(object):
    def __init__(self, num):
        self.num = num
    def __del__(self):
        global c
        if c is None:
            c = self
c = C(1)
while c is not None:
    c = None
    print "again"
</pre>
<p>This is an infinite loop in CPython: Every time <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">c</span></tt> is set to None in the
loop, the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__del__</span></tt> method resets it to the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">C</span></tt> instance again (note that
this is terribly bad programming style, of course. In case anybody was wondering
:-)). CPython can detect resurrection by checking whether the reference count
after the call to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__del__</span></tt> has gotten bigger.</p>
<p>There exist even worse examples of perpetual resurrection in particular in
combination with the cycle GC. If you want to see a particularly horrible one,
see <a class="reference" href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2005-August/055251.html">this discussion started by Armin Rigo</a>. In the ensuing thread Tim Peters
proposes to follow Java's example and call the finalizer of every object at most
once.</p>
<p>In PyPy the resurrection problem is slightly more complex, since we have GCs
that run collection from time to time and don't really get to know at which
precise time an object dies. If the GC discovers during a collection that an
object is dead, it will call the finalizer after the collection is finished. If
the object is then dead at the <em>next</em> collection, the GC does not know whether
the object was resurrected by the finalizer and then died in the meantime or
whether it was not resurrected. Therefore it seemed sanest to follow Tim's
solution and to never call the finalizer of an object a second time, which has
many other benefits as well.</p></body></html>

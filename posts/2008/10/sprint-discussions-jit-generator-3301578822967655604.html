<html><body><h2>Background</h2>
<p>Finally, the JIT post :-). First some background: Despite our plans at the end
of the EU period, PyPy's Python interpreter didn't get a good and widely
applicable JIT in the last year. The reason for that was that we discovered that
although the basic idea to generate JIT compilers is good, the concrete
prototype made during the EU period is basically flawed. It could have
been pushed a bit farther, but would have run into deep troubles eventually. One
of the problems would have been performance instability: change a seemingly
unrelated bit in your source program, and the performance changes in unexpected
ways, which is clearly not desirable. Another problem with that old approach is
that too much assembler code is generated, leading to memory problems, and also
that the generated assembler is bad in various ways, e.g. it is hard in that
approach to do proper register allocation.</p>
<p>Therefore we decided that it would be worthless to pursue this direction much
further. Instead we tried to research approaches to fixing the inherent
problems. This research was <a class="reference" href="http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2008/06/hi-all-some-news-from-jit-front.html">largely done in Prolog</a> and I eventually wrote my
<a class="reference" href="http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2008/10/prolog-jit-masters-thesis-finished.html">Master's thesis</a> about it. From the Prolog work we got some good insights into
what needs to be done and what sorts of techniques are needed. Also, it inspired
Armin to do some more exploration on a small <a class="reference" href="http://codespeak.net/svn/user/cfbolz/jitpl/branch/pyjitpl/">Python prototype</a> which used the
lessons learned from Prolog and also some additional ideas from tracing JITs. So
far, however, the prototype is neither in RPython, nor much integrated with
PyPy.</p>
<p>This research is not the only thing happening in the JIT-area. During the last
year, Antonio Cuni was working on <a class="reference" href="http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2008/05/progresses-on-cli-jit-backend-front.html">bringing the JIT to pypy-cli</a>. This
consisted mostly of writing a .NET backend for the old JIT-generator. Some
further work is being done since August by John Witulski, who is writing an
AMD64 backend for the JIT-generator for his Bachelor's thesis.</p>

<h2>Where to go from there</h2><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_zICyAWqZbLA/SPSRF3IFyqI/AAAAAAAAAFs/5rg6Vg9wqMI/s1600-h/jit.JPG"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5256986194931468962" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_zICyAWqZbLA/SPSRF3IFyqI/AAAAAAAAAFs/5rg6Vg9wqMI/s320/jit.JPG" style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;"></a><p>During the sprint we discussed in which directions we should continue now. We
plan to work quite a bit on the JIT in the coming months. Both Armin and Anto
are in DÃ¼sseldorf for four months, and them and me plan to mostly work on the
JIT (as well as giving a lecture on "Dynamic Programming Languages", trying to
ensnare some more students).</p>
<p>The first step will be to experiment a bit more with Armin's prototype. So far
it looks rather promising, but there are some unsolved issues that we need to
look into first. The first issue is to think a bit about how to efficiently do
profiling to compile only important code paths. The other large issue are
so-called "virtualizables". Roughly speaking, they are the frame objects of the
interpreter from which the JIT is generated. They need special treatment,
because on the one hand it is important that they get optimized away to make the
code fast, since the frames are accessed all the time for the local variables;
on the other hand they should still be usable for introspection if code is
around that is trying to look into them.</p>
<p>When this is done, the prototype needs to be ported to RPython, which is a
non-trivial task, since it is rather dynamic so far (it is rather important that
the unresolved issues are done before the porting, because once the prototype is
in RPython, experimentation will be harder). The porting has the potential to be
tedious, but in a sense it is "just work", as opposed to unclear research.</p>
<p>At this point it will become important to think about the backend interface. The
interface that the old frontend used to produce assembler code won't be usable
for the new approach, so things need to be rearranged slightly. Afterwards the
backends will have more information and be invoked at a slightly higher level,
which should allow them to produce better code.</p>
<p>When all this is done, the JIT generator will be in a rather good state and it
should become possible (modulo a lot of details, of course), to use it on the
Python interpreter.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I am intentionally not attaching any time estimates to this blog post. So far
our time estimates have not been very accurate when it comes to the JIT, which
only lead to disappointment when the JIT failed to materialize. We hope that we
will progress in interesting ways in the next four months, but who knows. Note
that we are really quite disappointed ourselves that it took so much longer than
we planned and hoped. The reason for this is mostly that this work really is
research and sometimes it is just hard to predict what sort of problems turn up.
Partial evaluation (the basis for our JIT generator) is a 30 years old technique
that was always just promising and never really successful, so the fact that we
think we can solve its problems in a few years is very much hubris anyway :-).
On the positive side, we think that we now know these problems much better than
ever before and that we have a plan that has a chance to succeed.</p>
<p>Also we are still convinced that our approach has huge potential, despite the
difficulties. If we manage to pull it off, it should be significantly simpler to
support new language features in the JIT and also to get speedups on some rather
interesting bits of the language. Some ideas we are having include generating a
JIT for the regex engine or speed up ctypes-bindings to be nearly as fast as an
extension module (or faster?). Also the JIT will be such that by construction
the JIT-generated code behaves identical to the original code, which isn't
always true for Psyco, for example.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>Thank you very much for this post Carl! I have a couple of questions:<br>You said you were experimenting with some ideas from tracing JITs. I wonder how much the new javascript VMs are influencing your work in pypy. Were these techniques  considered from the beginning or this is just because of the latest success of tracemonkey? And if so, are there ideas from Chrome's v8 or Squirellfish than could be applied too?<br>Do they change in any way your expectations regarding the potential of pypy concerning speed?</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>I also have done a fair amount of Boost.Python wrapping. I even created a code generator for it - Py++( www.language-binding.net). <br><br>The problem you want to solve is very complex. Exposing C++ code, as is, is not enough. You will have to create "bridge" between different concepts. <br><br>For example C++ and Python iterators. In C++, in order to get the iterator value, you have to dereference it. In Python, you just have it( value ).<br><br>This is just a single example, I have others. <br><br>If you continue with the project - I would like to be involved.</p></body></html>

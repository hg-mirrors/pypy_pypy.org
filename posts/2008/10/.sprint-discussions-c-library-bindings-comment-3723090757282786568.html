<html><body><p>Roman,<br><br>I haven't looked at the code of Boost.Python since a long time, but the way "we" do the pythonization of the iteration over STL sequences is rather simple.<br><br>when one writes:<br> foos = std.vector('FooKlass')()<br> # fill foos<br> # iterate<br> for foo in foos:<br>   print foo.value()<br><br>what the PyROOT/Reflex layer is doing is looking at the dictionary for the <i>std::vector(FooKlass)</i>, discovering that there is a pair of functions 'begin' and 'end' and it figures out one can create a python iterator from that pair.<br><br>anyways, as Maciej pointed it out, we could try to move this discussion here[1] or there[2]...<br><br>cheers,<br>sebastien.<br><br>[1] http://codespeak.net/pipermail/pypy-dev/2008q4/004847.html<br><br>[2] http://codespeak.net/pipermail/pypy-dev/2008q4/004843.html</p></body></html>

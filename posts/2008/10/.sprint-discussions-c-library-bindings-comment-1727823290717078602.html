<html><body><p>you might want to look at PyRoot [1,2,3] which is using the Reflex library to automatically wrap (and pythonize) the C++ libraries/types for which a Reflex dictionary has been (beforehand) generated.<br><br>theoretically any piece of C++ can be wrapped as Reflex is using gccxml[4] to extract informations from a library and to generat the dictionary library.<br><br>Using it in one of CERN's LHC experiment which makes heavy (ab)use of templates (Boost) I can say that we almost had basically no problem.<br>Usually the only problems we got were either at the gccxml level (resolution of typedef, default template arguments,...) or at the gccxml-to-reflex level (mainly naming conventions problems interfering with the autoloading of types at runtime)<br><br>Being a client of gccxml is a rather annoying as the development is... opaque.<br><br>I know the Reflex guys were investigating at some point to migrate to an LLVM version (with GCC as a frontend) to replace gccxml.<br><br>[1] http://wlav.web.cern.ch/wlav/pyroot/<br>[2] http://root.cern.ch/viewcvs/trunk/bindings/pyroot/<br>[3] http://www.scipy.org/PyRoot<br>[4] http://www.gccxml.org/</p></body></html>

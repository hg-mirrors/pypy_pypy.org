<html><body><p>Please add a C API :)<br><br>Once that is done, it's lots easier to interface with the outside world.<br><br>For a lot of C++ apis I find it easy enough to write a C api on top of it.<br><br>In fact many C++ apis provide a C API.  Since that makes it easier to work with different C++ compilers.  As you probably know different C++ compilers mangle things differently.<br><br>It is possible to look at C++ code at runtime.  You just need to be able to interpret the C++ symbols.  I know someone did a prototype of this for vc6 on windows.  He parsed the symbols, and then created the functions at run time with ctypes.  However the approach is not portible between platforms, compilers, or even different versions of compilers.  Of course this didn't allow you to use many of the C++ features, but only some.<br><br>If you look at how swig works, you will see it kind of generates a C API for many C++ things.<br><br><br>For libraries, it is custom to provide a C API.  It just makes things easier.</p></body></html>

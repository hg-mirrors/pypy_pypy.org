<html><body><p>illume: Adding a C-API is rather hard, and probably not on our todo list, unless somebody pays for it :-).<br><br>anonymous: From a quick glance I am not sure Elsa would really help. Yes, you can get use it to parse c++ headers and get information about it. But as far as I see it, you cannot use it to create shared libraries that can be used to dynamically construct classes and dynamically call methods on them. Besides, the idea is to have a solution that works on both CPython and PyPy. Reflex already has a way to bind C++ libraries to CPython, so we only need to do the PyPy part.<br><br>Anyway, if anybody is interested in more detailed discussions, we should all move to pypy-dev.</p></body></html>

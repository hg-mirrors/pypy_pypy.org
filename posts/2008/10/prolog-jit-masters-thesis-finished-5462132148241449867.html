<html><body><p>As we <a class="reference" href="http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2008/06/hi-all-some-news-from-jit-front.html">already blogged</a>, in the last half-year or so, Michael Leuschel, Armin
and me did a lot of JIT generator work on a <a class="reference" href="https://codespeak.net/viewvc/user/cfbolz/jitpl/dist/">Prolog prototype</a>. The idea was to
experiment more quickly with some techniques than what would have been possible
with RPython. These experiments were quite successful in themselves. With very
little code we managed to get a JIT that is not doing too badly when compared to
existing projects for Prolog.</p>
<p>This Prolog work was also the subject of my <a class="reference" href="https://codespeak.net/svn/user/cfbolz/jitpl/thesis/final-master.pdf">Master's thesis</a>. I finished the
thesis about two weeks ago (and since then have been mostly sleeping and then
sprinting). The thesis should be self-contained when it comes to explaining the
JIT concepts but needs knowledge of Prolog to be understandable.</p></body></html>

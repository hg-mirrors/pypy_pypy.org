<html><body><p>There's been some (small) discussion in the SWIG project of making an alternative output method which creates a simple C API for a C++ project, and wraps that with ctypes (generating the python side of the ctypes bindings, too).  So far, this is purely theoretical, but all the pieces needed to do it are present in the SWIG source code.  If reflex doesn't work out, this might be a reasonable alternative approach.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>Hi Brett,<br><br>I think the project most receptive to bug reports is LLVM, where bugs that we find are usually fixed within a small number of days. I think in general Open Source projects react quite well, as you would expect. A negative example is graphviz, which still segfaults despite us producing a patch which fixes the problem.<br><br>Microsoft proves to be completely unapproachable, it seems <i>you</i> have to pay <i>them</i> if you want to report a bug (should be the other way round, of course :-)).</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>In the last days we improved platform-support of PyPy's Python interpreter.
<a class="reference" href="http://jcalderone.livejournal.com/">Jean-Paul Calderone</a> has been tirelessly working for some time now on setting up a
<a class="reference" href="http://buildbot.net/">buildbot</a> for translating and testing PyPy. So far the basic mechanisms are
<a class="reference" href="http://pypy.intarweb.us/waterfall">working</a> and the buildbot is running on various machines, including some that
Michael Schneider (bigdog) lets us use, one of them being a Windows machine,
the other one with a 64bit Linux (lots of thanks to those two, you are
awesome!).</p>
<p>What is still missing is a nice way to visualize the test results to quickly see
which tests have started failing on which platforms. There is a <a class="reference" href="http://pypy.intarweb.us/summary">prototype</a>
already, which still needs some tweaking.</p>
<p>The availability of these machines has triggered some much-needed bug-fixing in
PyPy to make our Python interpreter work better on Windows and on 64 bit Linux.
Maciek and Michael Schneider worked on this quite a bit last week, with the
result that PyPy supports many more extension modules now on Windows and 64 bit
Linux. Since we now have the buildbot the hope is that the support also won't
disappear soon :-).</p></body></html>

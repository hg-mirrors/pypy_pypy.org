<p>The Leysin sprint has started since yesterday morning in the <a href="http://www.ermina.ch/cadre.html">usual location</a>. The view is spectacular (see photo) the weather mostly sunny. The following people are sprinting:
</p><ul><li>Maciej Fijalkowski</li><li>Armin Rigo</li><li>Toby Watson</li><li>Paul deGrandis</li><li>Antonio Cuni</li><li>Carl Friedrich Bolz</li></ul>So it is a rather small sprint.<p>We started working on various features and performance improvements for the high level backends (JVM and .NET) and on implementing ctypes for PyPy. Later this week we plan to spend a few days on the JIT, because Anto and I both need to get into it for our respective university projects.</p></body></html>

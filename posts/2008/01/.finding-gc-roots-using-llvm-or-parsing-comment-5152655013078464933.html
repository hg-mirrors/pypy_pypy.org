<html><body><p>Obviously it depends on the compiler, but the basic idea is that the natural place to support this is in the compiler itself.  For example, instead of parsing the assembler produced by GCC, it would probably be possible to extend GCC to cleanly generate stack maps.  (This is basically what I tried to do with LLVM, which gives a plug-in API to do that.)<br><br>After a bit of googling, GCC doesn't seem to support Objective-C 2.0 yet.  Moreover, the current Objective-C run-time library simply uses the conservative Boehm collector.</p></body></html>

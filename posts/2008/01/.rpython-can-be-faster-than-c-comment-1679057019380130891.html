<html><body><p>Hi Michael,<br><br>Leonardo is correct, the extension compiler was removed from SVN in November. We had many discussions about this step, but eventually it turned out to be necessary for many reasons. The extcompiler never was that useful in the first place because the produced extensions weren't fast (one of the reasons being the bad refcounting indeed).<br><br>The other reasons were that the extcompiler was impossible to maintain and was actually <i>preventing</i> progress, because it kept code alive that we wanted to get rid off.<br><br>So at the moment you cannot use PyPy any more to produce CPython extensions, only standalone programs.<br><br>It's completely possible that the extcompiler will be reborn in the future, but at the moment our priorities are really to make PyPy a good Python and not do tons of things on the side.<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Carl Friedrich</p></body></html>

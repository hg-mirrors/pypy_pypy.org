<html><body><p>I think a lot of people are interested in using RPython for performance reasons. But about nobody will leave CPython atm, because extension modules are not working.<br><br>At the moment, I wouldn't leave CPython since all I am doing is heavily based on scipy. And so my only option is (a) to wait PyPy being able to compile extensions for CPython or (b) PyPy making use of CPython extensions.<br><br>As long as this is not going to happen, I probably will not use RPython for serious projects. :/</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>I agree with Jonathan. There are many Python programmers who would *love* to be able to write Python extensions with RPython.<br><br>I know that this is already possible, but there are two issues:<br><br>* Lack of documentation on programming with RPython (I realise that this is a moving target)<br>* Last I heard, the refcounting implementation made RPython extensions inefficient<br><br>If these two issues were resolved (or mostly resolved) then a lot more people might start using the PyPy toolchain.<br><br>Asides from my growsing, it looks like PyPy is becoming more impressive by the day. Congratulations.</p></body></html>

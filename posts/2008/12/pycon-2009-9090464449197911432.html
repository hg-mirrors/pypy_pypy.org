<html><body><p>Hello.<br><br>
</p><p>
Both of our PyPy talks has been accepted for <a href="http://us.pycon.org">Pycon US 2009</a>. Although both
are somehow related to PyPy, they're vastly different in
topics, attitude and target audience.</p>
<p>
The first one is a classic PyPy status talk - we'll mostly talk about
our achievements from the last year (readers of this blog are aware of most,
but not all :) as well as some general introduction and plans for the future.
</p>
<p>
The second one is about PyPy's sandboxing features. This is in my opinion
a very underestimated feature, also by us, because it's not really well
advertised or documented. The main purpose of the talk is to present
to the general public how this works and how to use it.  Hopefully we will
get to work and publish about this a bit more ahead of Pycon already. 
Unlike Zope's Restricted Python, it provides you with the full python
language, inside a fully
virtualized sandbox, controlled from an external process by a custom
security policy. Stay tuned for more :-)
</p>
<p>
See you at Pycon 2009!
</p>
<p>
Cheers,<br>

<html><body><p>Hi Antonio<br><br>IronPython can create a method that looks like this<br><br>void object add(object a, object b)<br>{<br> throw new Exception("I don't know how to add")<br>}<br><br>into <br><br>void object add(object a, object b)<br>{<br>  if(a is int &amp;&amp; b is int)<br>    return (int)a + (int)b<br><br> throw new Exception("I don't know how to add")<br>}<br><br>and can further add new tests at runtime. The code do do the adding is written directly into the method body and there's no futher call needed. This is runtime code generation, not just caching<br><br>In your case, instead of having multiple methods implementing different blocks you could just rewrite the whole "master" method every time the flexswitch changes. That way there's no call overhead at all. That's what the DLR does. I think the main thing it's missing is promotion, so shared tests can't be moved up a level, and it doesn't do inlining.</p></body></html>

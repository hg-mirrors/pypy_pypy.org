<html><body><p>I'm a beginner programmer, so please excuse my beginner questions :-)<br><br>I just started learning Python as my first programming language.  Several of my programmer friends have said I should learn Java instead, one reason being the difference in performance - specifically for doing natural language processing / AI stuff which is the area I am interested in.<br><br>With PyPy, do you think it is likely that in the near future, Python's performance may be close to that of Java?  I do plan on learning multiple languages, but it would be nice if I could stick with Python for as long as possible :-)</p></body></html>

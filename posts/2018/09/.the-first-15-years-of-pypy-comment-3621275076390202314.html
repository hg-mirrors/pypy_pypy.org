<html><body><p>Hi Peterino! Thanks for testing your project on PyPy! PyPy is often slower on unit tests, as is explained here:<br>https://alexgaynor.net/2013/jul/15/your-tests-are-not-benchmark/<br><br>PyPy is best at CPU bound python code  It will never replace CPython but keep existing as an alternative python implementation.</p></body></html>

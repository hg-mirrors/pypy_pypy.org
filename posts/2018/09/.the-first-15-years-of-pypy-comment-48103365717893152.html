<html><body><p>Congratulations on your story, and the fantastic achievements!<br><br>Interestingly, from my personal experience I can't confirm the "PyPy is faster than CPython" claim. Maybe you can help me understand. I'm running a simple set of tests against a subset of Python versions of CPython and against PyPy, for a few years. For what I saw in that time, PyPy - including PyPy3 now - was always the slowest, usually by a factor of 2 compared to the mean of all CPython versions. See the results on Travis, for example: https://travis-ci.org/painless-software/painless-continuous-delivery<br><br>Why is it that way? When is PyPy really faster? Are the benchmarks you run tailored to a specific area of software development?<br><br>And then the final thing I've not yet understood about PyPy: What is the ultimate plan? Should it ever replace CPython, one day? When it proves to be both faster and less laborious to maintain, maybe?</p></body></html>

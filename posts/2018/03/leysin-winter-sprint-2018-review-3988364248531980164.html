<html><body><p>Like every year, the PyPy developers and a couple of newcomers
      gathered in Leysin, Switzerland, to share their thoughts and
      contribute to the development of PyPy.</p>
    <p>As always, we had interesting discussions about how we could
      improve PyPy, to make it the first choice for even more
      developers. We also made some progress with current issues, like
      compatibility with Python 3.6 and improving the performance of
      CPython extension modules, where we fixed a lot of bugs and gained
      new insights about where and how we could tweak PyPy.<br>
    </p>
    <p> We were very happy about the number of new people who joined us
      for the first time, and hope they enjoyed it as much as everyone
      else. <br>
    </p>

    The weather was really fine for most of the week, with only
    occasional snow and fog. We started our days with a short (and
    sometimes not so short) planning session and enjoyed our dinners in
    the great restaurants in the area. Some of us even started earlier
    and continued till late night. It was a relaxed, but also very
    productive atmosphere. On our break day on Wednesday, we enjoyed the
    great conditions and went skiing and hiking.

<html><body><p>I would love to see this get updated to Python 3.6.5. I'm currently using that for my programs, and even after looking at the changelogs between Python versions, I'm not sure what I'd lose by moving down to 3.5.3 so that I could use PyPy.<br><br>I'm also curious about things like IdleX and Anaconda. Would those be, hypothetically speaking, mergeable with PyPy?</p></body></html>

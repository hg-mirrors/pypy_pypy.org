<html><body><p>Congratulations to the team! This is getting more interesting with each release! <br><br>FWIW (not much, I know), I personally need two more things to start using pypy at work:<br>* Windows 64bit support<br>* pypy-specific conda packages for a few popular third-party packages (numpy, pandas, pytables, xlwings, ...)<br><br>If you would do a funding campaign specifically for either of those, I would donate, as I guess many people would.</p></body></html>

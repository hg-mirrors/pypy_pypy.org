<html><body><p>Hi, the Gothenburg sprint news are very interesting.<br><br>What are your thoughts about a release roadmap?. Do you intend to release a pypy 1.2 with improved compatibility and speed but no JIT, and later include the JIT (version 1.5, maybe?)?.<br><br>I think publishing some kind of roadmap would be useful, as a project suffers when its release cycles are BOTH long and unpredictable.</p></body></html>

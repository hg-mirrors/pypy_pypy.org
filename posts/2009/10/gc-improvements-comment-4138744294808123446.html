<html><body><p>Not really GC related and you may have covered this in another post, but how does PyPy handle id() in a world where the object may move?  Is the hash field reused for this when necessary as well?  If so, how do you deal with the possibility of another object being allocated at the same address as the original object?  If not, how do you avoid having an object's id() change when it's moved?</p></body></html>

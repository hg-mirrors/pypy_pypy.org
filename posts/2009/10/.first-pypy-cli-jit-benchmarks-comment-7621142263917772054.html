<html><body><p>@Michael: from the link you posted, it seems that tail call improvements in .NET 4 are only for x86_64, but my benchmarks were un on 32 bit, so I don't think it makes a difference. Anyway, I'll try to benchmark with .NET 4 soon, thanks for the suggestion.<br><br>@Anonymous: the paper is interesting, but I don't think it's usable for our purposes: throwing and catching exception is incredibly costing in .NET, we cannot really use them too heavily. The fact that the paper says nothing about performances is also interesting :-)</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>I'm astonished a bit by your need to pack vtables together within 256KB. How many bits do you need for mark-and-sweep marking or similar stuff? The usual solution I've seen for this is to use the low two bits of the vtable pointer for flags, usually, and mask them off when reading the vtable pointer. Would it work here?<br><br>If that isn't enough, then you have to pack vtables together as you do (maybe in a bigger space if you can use more bits).</p></body></html>

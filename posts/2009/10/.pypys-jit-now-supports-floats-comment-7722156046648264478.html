<html><body><p>awesome!  things are really starting to move along now :)<br><br>I tried the same little benchmark with the shedskin python to C++ compiler for comparison:<br><br>cpython2.5: 16.2770409584<br>cpython2.6: 12.2321541309<br>shedskin: 0.316256999969<br><br>Shedskin is 38.6 times faster than cpython2.6, and 51.4 times faster than cpython2.5... and to extrapolate from your numbers 3.9 times faster than the jvm.<br><br>Of course that doesn't include the time it takes to generate the C++ and then compile it with g++ (using the old 4.0.1 g++, not the latest 4.4).  I also didn't include the python interpreter startup cost.<br><br>btw, I found map, reduce and filter all to be faster with pure python versions when using psyco too.<br><br>cu!</p></body></html>

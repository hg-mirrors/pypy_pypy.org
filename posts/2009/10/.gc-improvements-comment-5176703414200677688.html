The fault in that case is CPython's general view that id() is cheap, despite repeated attempts to convince them otherwise.  These attempts have been done notably by guys from Jython, even before PyPy time; indeed id() is a mess for any implementation apart from CPython's simple non-moving GC).<br><br>A suitable replacement would be e.g. a 'collections.identitydict' type, if someone feels like going Yet Another Time to python-dev with this issue.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>I seem to recall grumblings from C++ programmers a few years ago when Java started supporting multi-core architecture, which made Java execution as fast or faster than C++ with much less development effort (for free with the Java interpreter vs hand-written C++ support).<br><br>If your testing machine is a multi-core/processor machine, it might be appropriate to say that PyPy is now as fast as C++ (without explicit multi-core support).

<html><body><p>kbob: I think they should be random enough. You get a collision if you ask the hash of object a, then a collection happens that moves a, then you ask object b for its hash and object b happens to be in the place where object a was before. That sounds unlikely.<br><br>If you write contrived code that has a loop that repeatedly allocates an object, asks its hash by putting it into a dict and then forces a nursery collection, you can get collision: all those objects will be at the beginning of the nursery when their hash is taken. Unlikely again to occur in practise.</p></body></html>

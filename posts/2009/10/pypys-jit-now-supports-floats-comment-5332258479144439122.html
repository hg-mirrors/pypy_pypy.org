<html><body><p>Great job! I really appreciate your work.<br><br>@Luis: I think, it does include the assembler. I just compiled trunk and ran the modified benchmark on python 2.6 and pypy-c-jit. Best time of 10 runs:<br>Python 2.6.2: 0.911113977432<br>Pypy: 0.153664112091<br>So it's nearly 6x faster for me (including the time for generating the assembler, of course) - even much better than on the postet numbers...I don't know, if cpython was run with the unmodified version of the benchmark though.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>Shams: Excellent question! The implementation of id that we have is basically a weak key dict mapping objects to ids on demand. This has the fun side-effect that the ids of PyPy's object start with 1 on count up from there.<br><br>This is rather inefficient (e.g. your garbage collections become linearly slower the more objects you have that have their id taken), but there is not much else you can do. Jython uses a similar solution. For this reason, calling id a lot is essentially discouraged in code you want to run on PyPy.</p></body></html>

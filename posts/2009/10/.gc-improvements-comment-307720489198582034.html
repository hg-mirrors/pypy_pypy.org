<html><body><p>Thanks, Carl.  Following up what Skandalfo said, (although this is probably a poor forum for such discussions), it seems like you could reuse the hash field for id as well.  Given that the minimum size for a Python object is &gt; 1 byte, you should have at least that much space for offsetting the hash/id. As the GC/allocator has to store information about addresses and blocks anyway it should be a relatively simple matter of building and maintaining a bloom filter of offsets in use for a particular base address.<br><br>Of course, this also constraints the addresses at which Python objects may be allocated and the lower bits in the address may already be used for other purposes...</p></body></html>

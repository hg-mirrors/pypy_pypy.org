<html><body><p>Good News!<br>Can't wait to try pypy as my standard python vm on my desktop machine.<br><br>Btw: Are there any plans yet for python generators support in the jit? <br>Because thats the only feature that I'm currently missing when using pypy. <br>I have some medium sized apps, that I'd like to try, but they often use generators, so these will be slower with jit than without, won't they?</p></body></html>

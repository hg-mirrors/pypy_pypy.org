<html><body><p>What about activating the Python Users Groups around the world? I think the case has to be made for PyPy still to the regular folk, if you will. So - what if you conducted a video showing off it's potential, or maybe a series of videos, much like the "Summer of NHibernate" series. All the while, on the same site as the videos, you have a "tips" jar for donations. The videos would serve as great marketing campaign and would invite the development community into the fold, earning the buy-in you seek. This kind of attention in the community would only serve the project well when attracting the larger fish to the pond.<br><br>Just my thoughts. :)</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>PyPy has recently made some great <a class="reference external" href="http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2009/11/some-benchmarking.html">speed</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2009/10/gc-improvements.html">memory</a> progress towards providing the most efficient Python interpreter out there.  We also just announced
<a class="reference external" href="http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2009/12/planning-next-release-of-pypy.html">our plans for the pypy-1.2 release</a>.  Much of this is driven by personal
commitment, by individuals and companies investing time and money.
Now we'd appreciate some feedback and help regarding getting money
into the PyPy project to help its core members (between
5 and 15 people depending how you count) to sustain themselves.  We see
several options:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>use a foundation structure and ask for tax-exempt donations to the
project, its developers and infrastructure.  We just got
a letter from the <a class="reference external" href="http://conservancy.softwarefreedom.org/">Software Freedom Conservancy</a> that they view
our application favourably so this option becomes practical hopefully
soon.</li>
<li>offer to implement certain features like a 64bit JIT-backend,
Numpy for PyPy or a streamlined installation in exchange for money,
contributed in small portions/donations.  Do you imagine you or your
company would sponsor PyPy on a small scale for efforts like this?
Any other bits you'd like to see?</li>
<li>offer to implement larger scale tasks by contracting PyPy related companies,
namely <a class="reference external" href="http://www.openend.se">Open End</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://merlinux.eu">merlinux</a> who have successfully done such
contracts in the past.  Please don't hesitate to contact
<a class="reference external" href="mailto:holger@merlinux.eu">holger@merlinux.eu</a> and <a class="reference external" href="mailto:bea@openend.se">bea@openend.se</a> if you want to start a
conversation on this.</li>
<li>apply for public/state funding - in fact we are likely to get some
funding through <a class="reference external" href="http://www.eureka.dlr.de/de/194.php">Eurostars</a>, more on that separately.  Such funding
is usually only a 50-60% percentage of actual employment and
project costs, and is tied to research questions rather than
to make PyPy a production-useable interpreter, though.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anything else we should look out for?</p>
<p>cheers &amp; thanks for any feedback,
Maciej and Holger</p></body></html>

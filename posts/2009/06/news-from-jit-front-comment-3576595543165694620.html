<html><body><p>Also, wouldn't it be better to refactor the plan as follows?:<br><br>- Improve the handling of GCs in JIT with inlining of malloc-fast paths, that should speed up things by a constant, not too big factor.<br>- Measure, write benchmarks<br>- Write a simplified python interpreter, which will be a base for experiments and to make sure that our JIT does correct things with regard to optimizations. That would work as mid-level integration test.<br>- Think about ways to inline loop-less python functions into their parent's loop.<br>- Measure, publish benchmarks, RELEASE 1.2<br>- Get rid of frame overhead (by virtualizables)<br>- Measure, publish benchmarks<br>- Iterate...</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>Please guys, can anyone of you tell something about Europython's vm panel news? I've been searching for comments on blogs in the last days but I couldn't find anything... There were many interesting presentations (hotpy, crosstwiner, psyco v2, etc...) but no comments so far! Is there any significant news in that field? How do these projects compare to pypy...?</p></body></html>

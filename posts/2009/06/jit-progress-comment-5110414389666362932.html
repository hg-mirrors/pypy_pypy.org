<html><body><p>From what I understand virtualizables are objects that you use to represent objects that are expensive to construct. For example frame objects in python are very expensive so they are virtualizables and if a function is executed and it doesn't try to access its frame object it is never created.<br><br>Probably armin can give a more precise answer.<br><br>What I want to know, couldn't CPython have virtualizables for frame objects? I guess the answer is that it could but would involve a lot of C code.</p></body></html>

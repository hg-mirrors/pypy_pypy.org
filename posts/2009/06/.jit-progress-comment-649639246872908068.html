However, the people who built CPython a) didn't know about them, b) didn't know how to code that in "C", or c) didn't consider it a priority item.<br><br>Either way, these are the types of advantages I would imagine coding python using python would expose. Optimize what you need to, and then start to see the real ROI of PyPy!</p></body></html>

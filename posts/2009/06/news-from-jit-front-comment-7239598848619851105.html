<html><body><p>Unladen-Swallow's LLVM JIT is a very different beast: it compiles each Python function as a unit.  You can only get a uniform bit of speedup this way (maybe 2-3x).  By contrast, what we are doing gives a non-uniform speedup: like Psyco, we will probably obtain speedups between 2x and 100x depending on the use case.<br><br>(Of course the plan is to be faster than Psyco in the common case :-)</p></body></html>

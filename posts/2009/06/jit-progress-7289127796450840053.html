<html><body><p>In the last days I finally understood how to do virtualizables.  Now the frame overhead is gone. This was done with the help of discussion with Samuele, porting ideas from PyPy's first JIT attempt.
</p>
<p>
This is of course work in progress, but it works in PyPy (modulo a few XXXs, but no bugs so far).  The performance of the resulting code is quite good: even with Boehm (the GC that is easy to compile to but gives a slowish pypy-c), a long-running loop typically runs 50% faster than CPython.  That's "baseline" speed, moreover: we will get better speed-ups by applying optimizations on the generated code.  Doing so is in progress, but it suddenly became easier because that optimization phase no longer has to consider virtualizables -- they are now handled earlier.
</p>
<p><b>Update:</b>Virtualizables is basically a way to avoid frame overhead. The frame object
is allocated and has a pointer, but the JIT is free to unpack it's fields (for example python
level locals) and store them somewhere else (stack or registers). Each external (out of jit) access
to frame managed by jit, needs to go via special accessors that can ask jit where those variables
are.</p></body></html>

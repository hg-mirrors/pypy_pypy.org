<html><body><p>Concerning current ideas vs April's roadmap: I understand that plans change and that's ok of course. But as April's roadmap isn't mentioned at all, I have no idea how the current ideas relate to the previous roadmap (like the current ideas replace the old road map or parts of it / they are additional ideas and the old roadmap is postponed / they are a detailing of (parts of) April's roadmap). Maybe that's obvious to people with better pypy-knowledge than me. I understand Armin's comment that they are additional ideas.<br><br>Keep up the good work!<br><br>Branko</p></body></html>

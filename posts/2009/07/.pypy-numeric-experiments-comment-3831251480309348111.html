<html><body><p>@ilume<br><br>I think you're completely missing the point. These experiments are performed using <b>pure-python</b> code that happens to operate on numpy arrays. Assembler generation happens when interpreting this code by the interpreter, so it's not really even the level of hand-written C. Corenumpy on the other hand is trying to speed up numpy operations itself (which is also a nice goal, but completely different).<br><br>Cheers,<br>fijal</p></body></html>

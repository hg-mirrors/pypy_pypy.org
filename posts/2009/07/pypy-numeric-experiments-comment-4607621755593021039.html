<html><body><p>Here's a project using corepy, runtime assembler to create a faster numpy:<br><br>http://numcorepy.blogspot.com/<br><br>There's also projects like pycuda, and pygpu which generate numpy code to run on GPUs.<br><br>It gets many times than standard numpy.<br><br>pygame uses SDL blitters, and its own blitters - which are specialised array operations for images... these are many times faster than numpy in general - since they are hand optimized assembler, or very efficiently optimised C.<br><br>Remember that hand optimized assembler can be 10x faster than even C, and that not all C code is equal.<br><br>So it seems that even the pypy generated C code could even be faster.<br><br>What about applying pypy to CUDA, or OpenCL C like languages?<br><br>cu,</p></body></html>

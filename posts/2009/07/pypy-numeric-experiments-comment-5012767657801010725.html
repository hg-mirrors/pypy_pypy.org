<html><body><p>Hi Maciej! Would you mind blogging an update on PyPy / C interfaces and NumPy?<br><br>I am extensively using NumPy / SciPy / NLopt (apart from apart from the stuff I import from there, my stuff is mostly pure Python algorithms, which interpreter spends most time working on).<br><br>The latest improvements in PyPy JIT really sound like if they could magically dramatically speed up my stuff...<br><br>I don't mind trying PyPy out in production if it will yield significant speedups and otherwise debugging why wouldn't it, but I need access to C stuff from within Python.</p></body></html>

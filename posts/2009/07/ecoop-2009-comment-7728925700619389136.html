<html><body><p>Is something like your PyPy Tutorial online somewhere?  I have a befunge interpreter that I've been meaning to get working on pypy but I have almost no idea where to begin.  I've been reading pypy's code on and off for awhile now and it's very slow going.  If there were some way to get up and running faster, I would really like to know about it.</p></body></html>

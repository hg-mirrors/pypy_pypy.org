<html><body><p>The difference in pure-python speed is what is most interesting for me, as however much NumPy you use, sometimes important parts of the software still can't be easily vectorized (or at all). If PyPy can let me run compiled NumPy (or Cython) code glued with lightning-fast Python, this leaves me with almost no performance problems. Add to that the convenience of vectorization as a means of writing short, readable code, and its a winning combination.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>Hello.
</p><p>
Recently, thanks to the surprisingly helpful Unhelpful, also known as Andrew Mahone,
we have a decent, if slightly arbitrary, set of performances graphs.
It contains a couple of benchmarks already
seen on this blog as well as some taken from <a href="http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/">The Great Computer
Language Benchmarks Game</a>. These benchmarks don't even try to represent "real applications"
as they're mostly small algorithmic benchmarks. Interpreters used:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
PyPy trunk, revision 69331 with --translation-backendopt-storesink, which is
now on by default
</li>
<li>
Unladen swallow trunk, r900
</li>
<li>CPython 2.6.2 release</li>
</ol>
<p>
Here are the graphs; the benchmarks and the runner script are <a href="http://www.looking-glass.us/~chshrcat/python-benchmarks/">available</a>

And zoomed in for all benchmarks except binary-trees and fannkuch.

As we can see, PyPy is generally somewhere between the same speed
as CPython to 50x faster (f1int). The places where we're the same
speed as CPython are places where we know we have problems - for example generators are
not sped up by the JIT and they require some work (although not as much by far
as generators &amp; Psyco :-). The glaring inefficiency is in the regex-dna benchmark.
This one clearly demonstrates that our regular expression engine is really,
really, bad and urgently requires attention.
</p>
<p>
The cool thing here is, that although these benchmarks might not represent
typical python applications, they're not uninteresting. They show
that algorithmic code does not need to be far slower in Python than in C,
so using PyPy one need not worry about algorithmic code being dramatically
slow. As many readers would agree, that kills yet another usage of C in our
lives :-)

<html><body><p>John: The main reason for writing a JIT that traces the bytecode of the "outer" interpreter (which we call language interpreter in the paper) is that then we need to write only one tracing JIT in PyPy, and can use it for a variety of languages.<br><br>The tracing of the extra bookkeeping code is not a problem is not such a large problem, as the paper shows. None of these opcodes are actually part of the final trace.<br><br>If you want to discuss this more, I would suggest that we move this discussion to pypy-dev@codespeak.net which is the project mailing list. Not everybody is reading comments here :).</p></body></html>

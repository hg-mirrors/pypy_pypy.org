<html><body><p>It does seem like an odd idea to trace the bytecode of an interpreter of the bytecode of a language, rather than just tracing the bytecode for a language. For example, it requires that you annotate the interpreter to retain information that you would otherwise naturally have, and it requires that you trace lots of extra bookkeeping code in the interpreter.<br><br>Given that you're writing a JIT that traces the execution of some bytecode, what advantages does tracing the outer bytecode have over tracing the inner bytecode? Is it that the outer bytecode is simpler than the inner bytecode; if so, is there no way to (inefficiently) compile the inner bytecode to the outer bytecode?</p></body></html>

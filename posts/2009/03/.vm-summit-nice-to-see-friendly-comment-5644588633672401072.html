<html><body><p>Maciej, this is a reply posted on the project's FAQ page:<br><br> Comment by collinw,  Today (8 hours ago)<br><br>luismgz: translating Python to Javascript would be easy to implement for about 80% of the language, but you'd hit a wall in implementing that last 20%. Just ask the Jython, PyPy? and IronPython? teams how hard 100% compatibility is. They've done some really heroic work to implement every dark and musty corner of the language, and I think they'd be the first to tell you that it's easy to get something like the Fibonacci function working, but things like metaclasses are a different story. We hope to side-step that by reusing as much of CPython as possible.<br><br>Psyco's claimed benefits of 100x speed-up on algorithmic code is rarely seen in real applications. It can certainly be used to optimize hotspots that fit Psyco's profile, but in examining the performance of some Google applications that use Psyco, we found that they see only a ~10% improvement in overall CPU usage. While that might be a valuable savings for some applications, it's not 100x, nor even the 2-4x low-end estimate that I've seen in the Psyco docs.<br><br>Are our performance goals too modest? We don't think so. Our team is small -- only two full-time engineers -- and we want to allow for unexpected surprises along the way. We feel that 5x is a good goal for the time being, especially given that we may need to make changes to LLVM along the way. If things go astoundingly well, we may raise those numbers, but for now, we're comfortable with our stated goals.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>Anonymous#1, this is extremely valuable note to take in an open source world, you know ;-)<br><br>PyPy folks, keep up the good work!<br><br>But... Sometimes I miss updates on this blog. Not in the sense that you slack on it, but in the sense that I miss some "technicaly intermediate" updates when there are no news on breathrouths.<br><br>One thing I miss most is the retro style articles on how some things that are "established" now got to be this way. The design by evolution things. Stuff that both educates and helps to get acquainted with the code one might like to hack one day.</p></body></html>

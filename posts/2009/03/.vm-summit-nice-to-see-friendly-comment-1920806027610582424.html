<html><body><p>I don't understand: These days, Google's v8 claims to be 56x faster than common javascript, tracemonkey is in the same league, as well as nitro, etc. Way before, psyco sped up python (theoretically) up to c's speed for algorithmic code, and up to 4x for common code.<br><br>Now Unladen Swallow aims to "only" 5x speed up. Isn't it to little, seeing what the above projects are getting nowadays?<br>Or am I getting confussed by their terminology? (what's exactly the meaning of 5x here?).</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>Next week i am going to give a talk on PyPy at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bossaconference.indt.org/">OpenBossa</a>, a developer conference on embedded platforms.  I've written up a bit more of my background and why i find it very interesting to go there <a class="reference external" href="http://tetamap.wordpress.com">on my blog</a>.  Probably will mostly follow up there or on twitter and not much here on the PyPy blog because it's not all about PyPy.  To summarize how i see it: i think there is great potential for Python and PyPy on mobiles and am thrilled to hear about what's going on currently and to discuss opportunities.</p>
cheers, holger</body></html>

<html><body><p>Hi Mikko!<br><br>thanks a lot for your comment and the pointer to the python-dev thread! <br><br>Like Martin von Loewis i'd be very interested to know more numbers regarding how the time for python imports is usually spent - i'd suspect the major bit comes from unmarshalling and the involved malloc/copying of data work.  If that is true then what i presented in the talk as "perfect pyc files" is probably a good idea.  It's basically what Martin suggested. <br><br>I find the unexec ideas interesting, especially on platforms where fork does not exist.  PyPy could probably have a very compact interpreter state representation if we perform garbage collection before writing to disk. When using moving GCs those objects would map very compactly into the oldest-generation memory and thus be mostly avoided by subsequent GC collects.<br><br>Of course, there also is time consumed for linking DLLs - only forking is  efficient in avoiding this overhead. But it doesn't exist on Symbian, right?   <br><br>If you have any more info on the exact numbers on import times, i'd be very curious.  We might also have some numbers from PyPy - need to check.<br><br>I am also available on holger.krekel at gmail com.  You are also very welcome to post to pypy-dev (http://codespeak.net/mailman/listinfo/pypy-dev)<br><br>cheers,<br>holger</p></body></html>

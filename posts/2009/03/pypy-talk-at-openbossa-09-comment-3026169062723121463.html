<html><body><p>Hi Holger,<br><br>About start up times: We have researched them a lot when developing few applications on Nokia's PyS60. <br><br>Our conclusion, for now, is that its imports and module body bytecode execution (loading modules, classes, creating functions) which takes the most of the time during the start up. Unfortunately there is no real way to speed up this process, except lazily trying to load all your code.<br><br>We have experienced with unexec() like solution. Unexec() was an old Emacs trick where a.out binary code and data segments are dumped to disk. When the application is loaded for the next time, this dump is just blitted to memory and execution continues. Kind of application level hibernation. You wouldn't actually need to distribute .pyc files at all for embedded devices, you could just give out a target specific binary dump containing ready memory layout.<br><br>Of course, it is not  so straightforward on modern system with DLLs and other funny pointers. We got some tests working with CPython and PyS60 emulator - but there would be tons of work to make it actually usable (patching all system libs and DLL loads to be suspend friendly).<br><br>Some discussion here:<br><br>http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2008-December/084466.html<br><br>Please reply at mikko (at) redinnovation (dot) com if you are interested in to hear more.</p></body></html>

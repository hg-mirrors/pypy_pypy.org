<html><body><p>First off - congratulations and good job on the great progress. I've been watching this project since the 2007 PyCon in DFW and it's great to see these promising results.<br><br>That said, while I know there's still a lot of work to do and this is very much an in-progress thing, I'm very much looking forward to an excuse to try this stuff out in anger - real practical situations. For me that means some statistical calculation engines (monto-carlo analysis) front ended by web services. In both situations this brings up two constraints: a) must support 64bit (because our data sets rapidly go above 4GB RAM) and b) must not be overly memory hungry (because any significant incremental overhead really hurts when your data sets are already over 4GB RAM).<br><br>For now we use Psyco for small stuff but have to re-implement in C++ once we hit that 32-bit limit. PyPy is very exciting as a practical alternative to Psyco because of anticipated 64bit support. I wonder if, due to the existence fo Psyco already, that PyPy shouldn't focus first on 64bit instead?<br><br>Few things would speed up progress than getting PyPy used out in the wild - even if only by those of us who appreciate it's very much in flux but still understand how to benefit from it.<br><br>I understand you guys have your focus and goals and encourage you to keep up the good work. Just thought I'd throw this out as an idea to consider. I'm sure there are a lot like me anxious to give it a spin.<br><br>  -- Ben Scherrey</p></body></html>

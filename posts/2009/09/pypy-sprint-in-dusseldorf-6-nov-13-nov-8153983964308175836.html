<html><body><p>The next PyPy sprint will be held in the Computer Science department of
Heinrich-Heine Universität Düsseldorf from the 6th to the 13th of
November 2009. This is a fully public sprint, everyone is welcome to
join us.</p>
<div class="section" id="topics-and-goals">
<h2>Topics and goals</h2>
<p>At the sprint we intend to work on the JIT generator in PyPy and on
applying it to PyPy Python interpreter.</p>
<p>The precise work that will be done is not fixed, as we don't know in
which state the JIT will be in November.  However, possible areas of
work might include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>tweaking the interpreter/objspace to be more JIT-friendly, e.g.
instance implementation code, call code</li>
<li>if there is interest starting non x86-32 JIT backends</li>
<li>trying out existing software to find features where the optimizations
of the JIT could be improved</li>
<li>improving our benchmarking infrastructure</li>
</ul>
<p>We will give special priority to topics that "non-core" people find
interesting (as long as they are somehow JIT-related).</p>
<p>For an introduction of how our JIT-generation process works, please
refer to our blog:</p>

<p>There is also a more dense academic paper about the subject:</p>

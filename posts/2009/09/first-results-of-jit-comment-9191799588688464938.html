<html><body><p>A correction/clarification to last night's post:<br><br>There isn't a bug in the -Ojit translation process, I was just missing a dependency that I could've sworn I've installed before.<br><br>The translation process only takes &lt; 1GB memory if done without any options.  Attempting to translate with the -Ojit option takes at least 2.5GB of RAM, as I tried last night (with it as the only running process) and it consumed my swapfile and ran out of memory.<br><br>Is there any documented way to use a translated pypy binary to build other pypy translations?  That might help reduce the build requirements, and would also be mighty cool.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>Hi all,</p>

<p>Just a quick note to tell you that we are progressing on the
JIT front.  Here are the running times of the <a href="http://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/trunk/pypy/translator/goal/richards.py">richards</a>
benchmark on my laptop:</p>

<ul><li>8.18 seconds with CPython 2.5.2;

</li><li>2.61 seconds with <code>pypy-c-jit</code> (3x faster than CPython);

</li><li>1.04 seconds if you ignore the time spent making assembler (8x faster than CPython);

</li><li>1.59 seconds on Psyco, for reference (5x faster that CPython).</li></ul>

<p>Yes, as this table shows, we are spending 1.57 seconds in the JIT
support code.  That's too much -- even ridiculously so -- for anything but a
long-running process.  We are working on that :-)</p>

<p>If you want to build your own <code>pypy-c-jit</code> (for x86-32 only for now):</p>

<ul><li>you need a Subversion checkout of <a href="http://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/trunk">trunk</a>;

</li><li>run <code>pypy/translator/goal/translate.py</code> with the <code>-Ojit</code>
  option;

</li><li>as usual, wait a long time (and be sure you have more than 1GB of RAM).</li></ul>

<p>For now <code>pypy-c-jit</code> spews a lot of debugging output and
there are a few <a href="http://codespeak.net:8099/summary?category=lib-python">known
examples</a> where it crashes.  As we like to repeat, however, it's a complete JIT:
apart from the crashes (the bugs are probably in the JIT support code), it supports the whole Python language from the start -- in the sense of doing correct things.  Future work include
Python-specific improvements by e.g. tweaking the data structures used to store Python objects so that they are more JIT-friendly.</p>

<p>EDIT: Oh yes, fijal reminds me that CPython 2.6 is 30% faster than CPython 2.5 on this benchmark (which is mostly my "fault", as I extracted a small part of PyPy and submitted it as a patch to CPython that works particularly well for examples like richards).  It does not fundamentally change the fact that we are way faster though.</p></body></html>

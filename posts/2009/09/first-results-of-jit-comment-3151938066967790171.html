<html><body><p>Ben Scherrey: 64bit support might happen not too far in the future. Not using too much memory is a different problem, that might take a while longer. It has two aspects, one is that the JIT itself uses way too much memory at the moment. We will work on that soon.<br><br>The other aspect is making sure that your dataset does not take too much heap. It depends a bit which data structures you use, but it's not likely to be that great right now.  That might change at some point, I have some ideas in that direction, but not really time to work on the soon.</p></body></html>

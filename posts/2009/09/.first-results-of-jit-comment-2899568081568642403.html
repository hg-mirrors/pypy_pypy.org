<html><body><p>This particular benchmark happens to be the one we use; there is no deep reason besides its relative simplicity (but it is not a microbenchmark, it's really computing something).  We will of course make more tests with a better range of benchmarks when things start to settle a bit.  Right now we are busy developing, and the numbers change every week.<br><br>It's also for this reason that there is no nicely-packaged release, sorry :-)<br>Note that translating your own pypy-c-jit is not a lot of work for you.  It is just a lot of work for your CPU :-)  You just do "svn co", "cd pypy/translator/goal" and "./translate -Ojit".</p></body></html>

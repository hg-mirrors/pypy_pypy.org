<html><body><p>Perhaps there is some way to store generated assembler code? I don't know too much about assembler or the JIT backend, but I assume that it'd be possible to stick the generated assembler code into a comment (or, if those don't exist, a docstring) in the .pyc file, so that a library that is commonly imported won't have to waste time generating assembler.</p></body></html>

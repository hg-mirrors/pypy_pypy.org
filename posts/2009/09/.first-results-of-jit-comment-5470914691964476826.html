<html><body><p>I was having the same problem as della, and your fix seems to work, but it's breaking somewhere else now. I don't think I have a dependency problem, I can build a working pypy-c without jit. Running make manually produces heaps of warnings about incompatible pointers, some probably harmless (int* vs long int*, these should be the same on x86-32), but others worry me more, like struct stat* vs struct stat64*, or struct SSL* vs char**.

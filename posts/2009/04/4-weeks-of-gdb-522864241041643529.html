<html><body><p>Hello.</p>
<p>
So, according to our <a href="http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2009/04/roadmap-for-jit.html">jit
plan</a> we're mostly done with point 1, that is to provide a JIT that compiles
python code to assembler in the most horrible manner possible but doesn't
break. That meant mostly 4 weeks of glaring at GDB and megabytess of assembler
generated by C code generated from python code. The figure of 4 weeks proves
that our approach is by far superior to the one of psyco, since Armin says it's
"only 4 weeks" :-)
</p>
<p>
Right now, pypy compiled with JIT can run the whole CPython test suite
without crashing, which means we're done with obvious bugs and the only
ones waiting for us are really horrible.  (Or they really don't exist.
At least they should never be about obscure Python corner cases: they can
only be in the 10'000 lines of relatively clear code that is our JIT
generator.)
</p>
<p>
But... the fun thing is that we can actually concentrate on optimizations!
So the next step is to provide a JIT that is correct *and* actually speeds
up python. Stay tuned for more :-)
</p>
Cheers,<br>

UPDATE: for those of you blessed with no knowledge of C, gdb stands for GNU debugger, a classic debugger for C. (It's also much more powerful than python debugger, pdb, which is kind of surprising).</p></body></html>

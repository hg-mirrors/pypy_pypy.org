<html><body><p>proteusguy: It is our hope that PyPy can one day replace CPython as the reference implementation, but this depends on many factors. Most of them are way out of our control. It will depend very much on the level of PyPy uptake in the community, but this is just a first step. With enough adoption, the Python developers (the people actually making new versions of CPython) need to be convinced that working from PyPy as a base to develop the language makes sense. If they are convinced, Guido may decide that it is a good idea and make the switch, but not before then.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>Nice job guys! Once you announce that PyPy is pretty much of comparable (90% or better) speed to that of CPython then we will be happy to start running capacity tests of our web services environment on top of it and report back our results. <br><br>Given the growing number of python implementations has there ever been a discussion of PyPy replacing CPython as the canonical implementation of python once it consistently breaks performance &amp; reliability issues? I don't know enough of the details to advocate such a position - just curious if there's been any official thought to the possibility.</p></body></html>

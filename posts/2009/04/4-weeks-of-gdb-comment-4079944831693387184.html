<html><body><p>Nice!<br><br>I assume that it would be (relatively, as these things go) straightforward for those us interested to turn the x86 assembly backend into a C backend?<br><br>I know that even mentioning number-crunching applications gets certain members of the pypy team beating their heads against the wall (lurkers can read the grumbling on irc too!).  But with a delegate-to-C backend, those of us who have unimplemented architectures and are in the happy regime where we don't care about compilation overhead can get the benefits of icc's excellent optimizations without having to do any of the work.  We'd just need to make sure that the generated C is code that icc can handle.  (There are unfortunately idioms that gcc and icc don't do very well with.)<br><br>To be clear, I'm not suggesting that the pypy team itself go this route: at the moment it feels like the rest of us should stay out of your way.. laissez les bon temps roulez! :^)<br><br>I'm asking instead if there are any obvious gotchas involved in doing so.</p></body></html>

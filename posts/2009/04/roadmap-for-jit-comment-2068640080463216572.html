<html><body><p>herse: that's an approach which is often mentioned, but which does not make sense in PyPy.  The JIT is generated from the language spec; whether this spec covers 95% or 100% of Python doesn't change anything.  The 95%-versus-100% debate only makes sense at another level, e.g. if we wanted to make PyPy faster without a JIT at all.</p></body></html>

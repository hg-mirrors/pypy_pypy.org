<html><body><p>PyPy without jit can (and is sometimes) be faster than cpython, for various reasons, including garbage collector.<br><br>On the other hand, we rather won't sacrifice simplicity for speed and we hope that jit will go that part. Also the funny thing is that since we generate our jit, it gets better as interpreter gets simpler, because jit generator is able to find out more on it's own. So in fact we might give up on some optimizations in favor of simplicity, because jit will be happier.<br><br>Cheers,<br>fijal</p></body></html>

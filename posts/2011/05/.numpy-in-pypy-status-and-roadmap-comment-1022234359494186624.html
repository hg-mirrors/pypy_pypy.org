<html><body><p>It's a tough call, but for me most libraries run under PyPy. There are few that don't but I can usually work around that. Regarding numpy - noone wants slower numpy *no matter what*. Besides, it's not clear whether making numpy behave using CPyext would take less effort than writing it from scratch - the first reasonable subset can be expected *much* faster, when doing a rewrite.<br><br>Numpy really *is* special, for all my needs, I want a small subset that performs reasonably well, not a whole thing that performs poorly. It's a matter of taste, but it's also much more fun, which plays a lot in terms of people spending free time on it. Would you rather add functionality for X that you need or fix next obscure segfault?<br><br>Cheers,<br>fijal</p></body></html>

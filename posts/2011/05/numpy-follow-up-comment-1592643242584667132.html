<html><body><p>Hi! <br><br>Thanks a lot for the previous post and the follow up! I really appreciate that you could find time to make a write up on the progress that you made so far on this extremely important feature.<br><br>This all sounds very cool, but also to me it seems that it's very important to work with NumPy / SciPy developers, so that the parts that have to be replaced would be isolated and maintained in parallel for RPython and C API, or rewritten in ctypes (not sure if this is even possible). This way this eternal catch-up trap that many seem to be afraid of will not happen.<br><br>Also, I wonder in how much money this would actually translate. Maybe Enthought could sponsor some development...<br><br>Regarding Cython... I also use it to write trivial extensions to implement computation kernels outside Python in C. It would be great if Cython were able to generate something that would work with PyPy as well...<br><br>Thanks!</p></body></html>

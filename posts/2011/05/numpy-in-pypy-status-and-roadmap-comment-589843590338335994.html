But if I'm right, the reality is that most of the reason I care about numpy is because scipy depends on it, and I care about scipy.<br><br>2) What about the numpy refactoring effort, which is supposed to be making a better C interface for numpy, which works with IronPython as well as CPython (http://lists.ironpython.com/pipermail/users-ironpython.com/2010-December/014059.html)? Why not just encourage that effort, and leverage it for PyPy integration? Is there a reason it won't work for numpy even though it works for both IronPython and CPython? (</p></body></html>

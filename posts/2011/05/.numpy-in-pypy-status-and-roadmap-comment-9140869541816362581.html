<html><body><p>@Nick the mixed approach (use cpyext and pieces in RPython) sounds maybe valuable short term, but it can burn people easily. RPython-only is way more elegant and gives you wins upfront. Since there is noone willing to invest time in short term approach, this sounds like a no-brainer.<br><br>@matt almost nothing should be implemented in RPython, except the interpreter itself. Writing Python should be fast enough. Numpy is a notable example where we want to leverage last bits and pieces of JIT and be really really fast. For example you can't really leverage SSE from Python layer.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>Are you distinguishing between the time it takes to setup the optimization problem and the time it takes to actually solve it?<br><br>GLPK is a simplex solver written in C, and CVXOPT is an interior point solver written in Python/C and is not particularly optimized for sparse problem. Nevertheless, you should check the you actually formulate a large sparse problem in CVXOPT, and not a dense one.</p></body></html>

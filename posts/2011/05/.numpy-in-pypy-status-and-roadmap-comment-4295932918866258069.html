<html><body><p>To everybody asking why we cannot just use cpyext: I already tried it. It's not gonna happen without hacking the crap out of numpy. Additionally, it's going to be slow: Numpy is not fast for most operations, because of double-unboxing. Only vector ops are fast. JITing the operations is going to be a big win.<br><br>For those of you not believing numpy is slow, look at numexpr (http://code.google.com/p/numexpr/) which implements many of the same ideas that we are planning on implementing.</p></body></html>

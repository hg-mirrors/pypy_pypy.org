<html><body><p>You say you lack sufficient resources to put in a large effort, but your answers to CPython extensions is "reimplement everything RPython".  Would it not make more sense to improve cpyext so that you get good performance out of it (maybe even JIT compatible)?  This seems like a better answer then re-writing every single CPython extension and trying to keep the RPython implementation in sync.</p></body></html>

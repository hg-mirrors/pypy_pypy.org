<html><body><p>I would like to repeat the numpy and scipy thing. I have to add matplotlib, which a lot of people use for plotting. Personally I also cannot live without h5py, which is awesome for storing and handling numerical data. I have no idea if it will work with pypy, because it does require numpy first.<br><br>I'm looking forward to pypy becoming faster, better supported, and more popular! I am convinced that it will.</p></body></html>

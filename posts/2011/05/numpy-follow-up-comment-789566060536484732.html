<html><body><p>Isn't there another fairly major drawback to implementing in RPython - that you can only use it if it is compiled (translated) at the same time as pypy. So effectively pypy *has* to be distributed with all the RPython extensions you will ever use, or you have to retranslate *everything* whenever you add a new extension.<br><br>Developing cross-platform, cross-architecture, stuff with ctypes can also be a lot more painful than writing extensions using the Python C API (and having the compiler make some decisions at compile time rather than having to do it all at runtime).</p></body></html>

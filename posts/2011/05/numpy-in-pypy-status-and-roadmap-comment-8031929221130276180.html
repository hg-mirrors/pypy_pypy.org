<html><body><p>@Maciej: It was clear to me that numpy users shouldn't change anything, but I thought you intended to change only the Python part of Numpy, not the C part. <br><br>Now, if you plan to change the whole C sections, that's a huge job. What are your plans for dependencies like  the BLAS, LAPACK and the likes? Would you reimplement them in RPython as well?<br><br>And regardless of the answer, my question is still valid: do you see this project as a "catch-up porting" of Numpy, with the version for CPython going on by itself? Or do you see the RPython fork becoming the mainstream Numpy? And if it's the latter, how that would perform on CPython? I think these questions are the key of the matter.</p></body></html>

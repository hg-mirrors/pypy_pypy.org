<html><body><p>Hi maciej, I am david (we quickly met at pycon where I presented myself as a numpy guy).<br><br>I think part of the misunderstanding is around the meaning of "numpy in pypy". Rewriting an array class on top of pypy is certainly valuable, and I am in no position to tell other people what to do in their free time. But I don't think it can realistically mean people will be able to use this instead of numpy after 2-3 man months: how will interfacing with BLAS/LAPACK work ? How will interfacing with the vast amount of fortran code in scipy work ?<br><br>If cpyext is indeed a dead-end, it would valuable to know why. Personally, I would certainly be happy to fix parts of numpy that makes cpyext impractically, even if it meant it were twice slower than on cpython. Because I could still benefit from pypy *elsewhere*, without having to rewrite all the numpy/scipy/etc... code.</p></body></html>

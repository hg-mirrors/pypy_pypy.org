<html><body><p>@Anonymous: While you may not be concerned with performance, a great many people are.  The only way to have arbitrary numpy stuff work in theory would be CPyExt, but as we've said that's frought with complications in that a) it won't work out of the box on something that uses as many corners of the CPython C-API as NumPy, and b) will always be slow.  Given people's desire for speed with respect to NumPy we consider reimplementing it a reasonable course.</p></body></html>

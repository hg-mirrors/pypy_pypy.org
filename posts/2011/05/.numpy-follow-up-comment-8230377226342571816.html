<html><body><p>I think that the most important part of numpy is array operations (indexing, +-*/, broadcasting, etc). So it would be good enough to implement only array class in RPython and call to numpy using ctypes/cpyext for all other stuff. I've read somewhere about the plans to impose separation between numpy and scipy so numpy holds only implementation of fast arrays and scipy will hold all non-trivial operations on them. IMHO such separation will be ideal for pypy too.</p></body></html>

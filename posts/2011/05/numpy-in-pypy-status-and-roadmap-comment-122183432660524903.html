<html><body><p>@Joseph cpyext will always be only a semi-permanent compatibility layer. Making numpy work with cpyext is both unrewarding (hard work with obscure bugs), but also significantly harder to make fast, in some places completely impossible. Yes, it doesn't make sense for all extensions, it doesn't even make sense for most. Numpy is however special, since speed is the reason of it's existence. Also, frankly, when it comes down to my free time "let's make this cool JITed code run 50x faster than CPython" beats "let's stare puzzled at this segfault".</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>To address some of the criticism you're receiving, it may be worth making another post clarifying the points made in the comments and elsewhere:<br><br>- numpy+cpyext has been tried and found wanting (and very hard to debug)<br>- no developers available that are interested in beating their heads against that particular wall<br>- pure C and Python components of numpy should remain largely the same<br>- only the Python bindings layer that uses the CPython C API needs to be reimplemented<br>- RPython has its own FFI which is PyPy's preferred way to interface to non-Python code (http://pypy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/rffi.html)<br>- cpyext is a useful tool for compatibility with relatively simple C extensions that don't stress the C API greatly, but numpy is not such an extension.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>@Davide it's not Python vs RPython, it's C (which numpy is implemented in) vs RPython. No numpy users will be requires to use RPython for anything.<br><br>@Gary I believe you're wrong. The idea stays the same - you can call arbitrary C code that will manipulate raw memory and do what it wants to do. The idea is to implement only the interface part (which uses CPython C API) and not the C part, which will work anyway. So at the end, we hope to leverage that effort. Also we're not microsoft and we can't pay large sums of money to do it and having small subset of numpy that's really fast appeals much more to me than a large effort that only gives numpy for pypy (that's not faster than cpython's one).</p></body></html>

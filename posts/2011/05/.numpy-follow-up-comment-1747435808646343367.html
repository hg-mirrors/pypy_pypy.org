<html><body><p>thanks for the follow-up. I won't argue with points 1 and 3, but I think 2 can be reasonably addressed: I don't think the usage of internal details is pervasive in the code, and most of it is for historical reasons. We cannot remove them altogether from the numpy headers for backward compatibility reasons, but we can replace most of it inside numpy itself.<br><br>I am still a bit confused though: from your description, it seems that you intend to fork numpy to replace some pieces from C to RPython, but if I look at the numpy-ext branch, I see a rewrite of numpy in rpython. Maybe you are talking about another code ?</p></body></html>

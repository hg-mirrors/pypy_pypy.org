<html><body><p>I'd love to use PyPy in some of my projects, but they rely on lots of 3rd-party C/C++-based libraries.<br><br>1) lxml, thats an absolute must for most of my applications. Original ETree now lacks many features lxml has, so there is no ready pure-python replacement avail.<br>2) Some my own boost::python libraries. I didn't actually try to compile them on PyPy, but as I was told on IRC, support for b::p is still marginal.<br>3) PycURL, PyV8, PyQt, wxPython and so on.</p></body></html>

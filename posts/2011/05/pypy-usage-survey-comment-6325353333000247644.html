However, before making an investment, we need to be sure that:<br><br><br>- PyPy won't go away like Psyco did. A kind of "mainstream endorsement" by PSF would be helpful<br><br><br>- numpy and scipy are available <br><br>- a decent ODBC package is available (we're using mxODBC) at the moment<br><br>- full support on Windows 32 and 64 bit<br><br><br><br>Best regards, Martin<br><br>  Swisscom IT Services Finance</p></body></html>

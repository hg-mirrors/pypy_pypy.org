<html><body><p>Hi,<br><br>as for upcoming sprint... <br><br>The grid on http://speed.pypy.org/timeline/ is a totally great idea. However the benchmark tests listed represent no progress since a long time already. <br><br>Q1. Does it mean that the set is not representative any more and should be extended?<br><br>Q2. Is it possible to include some micro benchmarks, please? (Oh, please!)</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>I've a project wich use psyco with a factor 15 (computation of train path) ! yes really, this project is in production (unfortunately not open source) ! I just tried it with pypy 1.5, and it works with the same factor (congratulation to you). So i'm sure that we'll use pypy.<br><br>But like my other project, i don't change something wich already works. Most of them don't need speed improvement.<br><br>On one scrabble game i'd like to replace a scrabble solver in C (if someone wants to help, it's opensource ?)<br><br>I also hope to see a debian package in the next debian release...<br><br>Thanks for your work, i follow it !</p></body></html>

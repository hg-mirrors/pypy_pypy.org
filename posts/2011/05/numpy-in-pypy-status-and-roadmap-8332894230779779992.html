<html><body><p>Hello.</p>
<p>NumPy integration is one of the single most requested features for PyPy. This
post tries to describe where we are, what we plan (or what we don't plan), and
how you can help.</p>
<p><strong>Short version for the impatient: we are doing experiments, which show that
PyPy+numpy can be faster and better than CPython+numpy.  We have a plan on how
to move forward, but at the moment there is lack of dedicated people or money
to tackle it.</strong></p>
<div class="section" id="the-longer-version">
<h3>The slightly longer version</h3>
<p>Integrating numpy in PyPy has been my pet project on an on-and-off (mostly off)
basis over the past two years. There were <a class="reference external" href="http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2009/07/pypy-numeric-experiments.html">some experiments</a>, then a long
pause, and then some more experiments which are documented below.</p>
<p>The general idea is <strong>not</strong> to use the existing CPython module, but to
reimplement numpy in RPython (i.e. the language PyPy is implemented in), thus
letting our JIT achieve extra speedups. The really cool thing about this part
is that numpy will automatically benefit of any general JIT improvements,
without any need of extra tweaking.</p>
<p>At the moment, there is branch called <a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/tree/branch/numpy-exp/">numpy-exp</a> which contains a
translatable version of a very minimal version of numpy in the module called
<tt class="docutils literal">micronumpy</tt>. <a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/tree/branch/numpy-exp/pypy/module/micronumpy/bench/">Example benchmarks</a> show the following:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="53%">
<col width="25%">
<col width="22%">
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td>Â </td>
<td>add</td>
<td>iterate</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>CPython 2.6.5 with numpy 1.3.0</td>
<td>0.260s (1x)</td>
<td>4.2 (1x)</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>PyPy numpy-exp @ 3a9d77b789e1</td>
<td>0.120s (2.2x)</td>
<td>0.087 (48x)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">add</tt> benchmark spends most of the time inside the <tt class="docutils literal">+</tt> operator on
arrays (doing <tt class="docutils literal">a + a + a + a + a</tt>), , which in CPython is implemented in C.
As you can see from the table above, the PyPy version is already ~2 times
faster. (Although <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/numexpr/">numexpr</a> is still faster than PyPy, but we're working on it).</p>
<p>The exact way array addition is implemented is worth another blog post, but in
short it lazily evaluates the expression and computes it at the end, avoiding
intermediate results. This approach scales much better than numexpr
and can lead to speeding up all the operations that you can perform on matrices.</p>
<p>The next obvious step to get even more speedups would be to extend the JIT to
use SSE operations on x86 CPUs, which should speed it up by about additional
2x, as well as using multiple threads to do operations.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">iterate</tt> is also interesting, but for entirely different reasons. On CPython
it spends most of the time inside a Python loop; the PyPy version is ~48 times
faster, because the JIT can optimize across the python/numpy boundary, showing
the potential of this approach, users are not grossly penalized for writing
their loops in Python.</p>
<p>The drawback of this approach is that we need to reimplement numpy in RPython,
which takes time.  A very rough estimate is that it would be possible to
implement an useful subset of it (for some definition of useful) in a period
of time comprised between one and three man-months.</p>
<p>It also seems that the result will be faster for most cases and the same speed
as original numpy for other cases. The only problem is finding the dedicated
persons willing to spend quite some time on this and however, I am willing to
both mentor such a person and encourage him or her.</p>
<p>The good starting point for helping would be to look at what's already
implemented in micronumpy modules and try extending it. Adding a <cite>-</cite> operator
or adding integers would be an interesting start. Drop by on #pypy on
irc.freenode.net or get in contact with developers via some other channel (such
as the pypy-dev mailing list) if you want to help.</p>
<p>Another option would be to sponsor NumPy development. In case you're
interested, please get in touch with us or leave your email in comments.</p>

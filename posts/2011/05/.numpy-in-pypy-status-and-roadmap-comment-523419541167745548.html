<html><body><p>@daniel: I don't think there is a misunderstanding as much as a different people wanting different things. I believe that Maciej and other pypy people are more interested in leveraging pypy and its JIT do to things which are indeed quite complicated in numpy today (avoid temporary, fast  iterators in python, etc...). I have little doubt that pypy is a better platform than cpython to experiment this kind of things.<br><br>I am more surprised about the claim that numpy is so tight to cpyhon internals. It certainly depends on the C API, but mostly public API, documented as such.</p></body></html>

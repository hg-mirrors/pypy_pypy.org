<html><body><p>Hi everyone.  Since yesterday's blog post we got a ton of feedback, so we want
to clarify a few things, as well as share some of the progress we've made, in
only the 24 hours since the post.</p>
<h3>Reusing the original NumPy</h3>
<p>First, a lot of people have asked why we cannot just reuse the original NumPy
through <tt class="docutils literal">cpyext</tt>, our CPython C-API compatibility layer.  We believe this is
not the best approach, for a few reasons:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">cpyext</tt> is slow, and always will be slow. It has to emulate far too many
details of the CPython object model that don't exist on PyPy (e.g.,
reference counting). Since people are using NumPy primarily for speed this
would mean that even if we could have a working NumPy, no one would want to
use it.  Also, as soon as the execution crosses the <tt class="docutils literal">cpyext</tt> boundary, it
becomes invisible to the JIT, which means the JIT has to assume the worst
and deoptimize stuff away.</li>
<li>NumPy uses many obscure documented and undocumented details of the CPython
C-API. Emulating these is often difficult or impossible (e.g. we can't fix
accessing a struct field, as there's no function call for us to intercept).</li>
<li>It's not much fun. Frankly, working on <tt class="docutils literal">cpyext</tt>, debugging the crashes,
and everything else that goes with it is not terribly fun, especially when
you know that the end result will be slow. We've demonstrated we can build
a much faster NumPy, in a way that's more fun, and given that the people
working on this are volunteers, it's important to keep us motivated.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, we are <strong>not</strong> proposing to rewrite the entirety of NumPy or, god
forbid, BLAST, or any of the low level stuff that operates on C-level arrays,
only the parts that interface with Python code directly.</p>
<h3>C bindings vs. CPython C-API</h3>
<p>There are two issues on C code, one has a very nice story, and the other not so
much. First is the case of arbitrary C-code that isn't Python related, things
like <tt class="docutils literal">libsqlite</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">libbz2</tt>, or any random C shared library on your system.
PyPy will quite happily call into these, and bindings can be developed either
at the RPython level (using <tt class="docutils literal">rffi</tt>) or in pure Python, using <tt class="docutils literal">ctypes</tt>.
Writing bindings with <tt class="docutils literal">ctypes</tt> has the advantage that they can run on every
alternative Python implementation, such as Jython and IronPython.  Moreover,
once we merge the <tt class="docutils literal">jittypes2</tt> branch <tt class="docutils literal">ctypes</tt> calls will even be smoking
fast.</p>
<p>On the other hand there is the CPython C-extension API. This is a very specific
API which CPython exposes, and PyPy tries to emulate. It will never be fast,
because there is far too much overhead in all the emulation that needs to be
done.</p>
<p>One of the reasons people write C extensions is for speed.  Often, with PyPy
you can just forget about C, write everything in pure python and let the JIT to
do its magic.</p>
<p>In case the PyPy JIT alone isn't fast enough, or you just want to
use existing C code then it might make sense to split
your C-extension into 2 parts, one which doesn't touch the CPython C-API and
thus can be loaded with <tt class="docutils literal">ctypes</tt> and called from PyPy, and another which does
the interfacing with Python for CPython (where it will be faster).</p>
<p>There are also libraries written in C to interface with existing C codebases,
but for whom performance is not the largest goal, for these the right solution
is to try using CPyExt, and if it works that's great, but if it fails the
solution will be to rewrite using <cite>ctypes</cite>, where it will work on all Python
VMs, not just CPython.</p>
<p>And finally there are rare cases where rewriting in RPython makes more sense,
NumPy is one of the few examples of these because we need to be able to give
the JIT hints on how to appropriately vectorize all of the operations on an
array.  In general writing in RPython is not necessary for almost any
libraries, NumPy is something of a special case because it is so ubiquitous
that every ounce of speed is valuable, and makes the way people use it leads to
code structure where the JIT benefits enormously from extra hints and the
ability to manipulate memory directly, which is not possible from Python.</p>
<h3>Progress</h3>
<p>On a more positive note, after we published the <a class="reference external" href="http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2011/05/numpy-in-pypy-status-and-roadmap.html">last post</a>, several new people
came and contributed improvements to the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">numpy-exp</span></tt> branch. We would like to
thank all of them:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>nightless_night contributed: An implementation of <tt class="docutils literal">__len__</tt>, fixed bounds
checks on <tt class="docutils literal">__getitem__</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">__setitem__</tt>.</li>
<li>brentp contributed: Subtraction and division on NumPy arrays.</li>
<li>MostAwesomeDude contributed: Multiplication on NumPy arrays.</li>
<li>hodgestar contributed: Binary operations between floats and NumPy arrays.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Those last two were technically an outstanding branch we finally merged, but
hopefully you get the picture. In addition there was some exciting work done by
regular PyPy contributors. I hope it's clear that there's a place to jump in
for people with any level of PyPy familiarity. If you're interested in
contributing please stop by #pypy on irc.freenode.net, the <a class="reference external" href="http://codespeak.net/mailman/listinfo/pypy-dev">pypy-dev</a> mailing
list, or send us pull requests on <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy">bitbucket</a>.</p>

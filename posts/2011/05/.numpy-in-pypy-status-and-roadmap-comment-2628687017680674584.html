<html><body><p>Alex -- I'm not saying speed is unimportant. What I'm saying is being able to easily make existing CPython extension modules compile against numpy is very important to people. If there is a 20% slowdown or a 10% speedup of the C extension in many cases that is no big deal. Most importantly it would put PyPy on rather equal standing with CPython. And then the JIT pure Python code might win out for efficiency, so PyPy might be a net win for many users.<br><br>On the other hand doing research into lazy evaluation and vectorizing and loop restructuring, can obviously make numpy faster, but is more of a tangent, than being helpful to the majority of users who just want to run their CPython extensions at roughly the same speed under PyPy. Until people can actually run their extensions easily (which I argue is the major value that Python has) I doubt there will be much adoption of PyPy.<br><br>Say I can already add lists of floats and take their standard deviation using numpy, using the C extension library. It isn't clear to me why this should be substantially less efficient under PyPy than under CPython.<br><br>We see the same issue with Python 3.0 adoption. Personally I think it makes bad language changes such as getting rid of string % operator which I use constantly, so I'd avoid it for that reason. But far more importantly it can't run a lot of the libraries I use, with comparable performance. So it's completely a no go to me for that reason.<br><br>So I am suggesting that optimizing a single library by rewriting it, seems a case of premature optimization when most libraries can't even run with PyPy.</p></body></html>

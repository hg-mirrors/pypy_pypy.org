<html><body><p>Maciej (et all),<br>it looks like this issue isn't clear yet to people. Let's see if I can help.<br><br>Numpy is made of 3 "piece" (doesn't matter if they are separate pieces or mingled together, they are there): a pure python part, a pure C part and a C-to-python "glue". All of them are very important to numpy, but the C-to-python glue is special, in that both python and C need to access the same data structures without any conversion or copy (otherwise it will be slow). I'm not sure what exactly numpy is doing for this "special glue" part, but that's the point where pypy suffer: of course pypy works just fine with pure python, and doesn't "care" at all about the C sections. So one option is to rewrite the C-to-python pieces of numpy. I'm sorry but it's still unclear to me if you want also to rewrite the C part or not (here you said kind-of-yes: http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2011/05/numpy-in-pypy-status-and-roadmap.html?showComment=1304533136864#c3499269873134208179 and here you said no: http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2011/05/numpy-in-pypy-status-and-roadmap.html?showComment=1308734098907#c2151221303214453177 so probably you should clarify better)<br><br>Now, if I understand it right, your plan is to fork numpy for this purpose (either rewrite the C-to-python glue only, or the C part also). I believe this will fail, and the reason is pretty simple: first, even before you start, you already say that you don't have people/money/time to commit to this project. Second, maintaining a fork is a huge, huge task. You might easily introduce bugs, break feature, etc - while people are expecting something that "just works" as drop-in replacement, so even a "almost success" from a technical point of view, can be a big failure for adopter, if it doesn't behave. Last, but not least, numpy is a moving target, and you'll always play catch up. Is this the game you want to play??<br><br>Now, I don't want to tell you what you have to do for fun, but if you want to have chances of success, you have to change the "politics" of your plan. I trust you that technically your plan is fine, but rather than implementing it within a numpy fork (or worst: rewrite), I suggest that you work with the numpy and/or CPython community, to see if you can write a wrapper around cpyext (or whatever they are using for C-to-Python glue). This wrapper (at compiler time) should either become cpyext (or whatever) if you are using CPython, or become "something else" if you are using pypy. If you persuade numpy people to use this wrapper you'll have the same numpy code base working as is in CPython and pypy. Sure you will not be exploiting the faster-than-C capabilities of pypy, but you can get there more smoothly: improving the speed one feature at time, while the rest of the framework is still working and thus useful, and thus increasing its user base, people interested in it (and some of them may become contributors).<br><br>Instead your plan sounds like:  implement one feature at time, while the rest of the framework doesn't work and thus nobody uses it in production, let alone care about its speed. On top of which, you'll be trying to catch-up with numpy.</p></body></html>

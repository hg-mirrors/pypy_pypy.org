<html><body><p>Maciej -- I didn't realize large parts of these libraries could be reused. So maybe once the PyPy C extension facilities are working well enough that important 3rd party libraries can be compiled, I'll just switch to PyPy for performance. It sure does sound more fun to make numpy functions compile down to heavily optimized RPython and get big speed gains. But I still maintain that users would appreciate being able to get all arbitrary libraries to build in the first place, e.g. if scipy or library X depends on the numpy C interface, and that gets broken in the PyPy numpy implementation, then users won't be able to use their desired library at all. So I guess I'm just arguing that the most C extension modules that can work with numpy, the better. Since if we wanted fast but no libraries we'd be using C :-).</p></body></html>

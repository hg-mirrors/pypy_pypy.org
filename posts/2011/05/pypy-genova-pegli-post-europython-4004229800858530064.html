Goals and topics of the sprint</h1>
<ul>
<li><div class="first">
Now that we have released 1.5, the sprint itself is going to be mainly
working on fixing issues reported by various users.  Possible topics
include, but are not limited to:</div>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>fixing issues in the bug tracker</li>
<li>improve cpyext, the C-API compatibility layer, to support more extension
modules</li>
<li>finish/improve/merge jitypes2, the branch which makes ctypes JIT friendly</li>
<li>general JIT improvements</li>
<li>improve our tools, like the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/jitviewer">jitviewer</a> or the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/buildbot/">buildbot</a> infrastructure</li>
<li>make your favorite module/application working on PyPy, if it doesn't yet</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><div class="first">
Of course this does not prevent people from showing up with a more precise
interest in mind  If there are newcomers, we will gladly give introduction
talks.</div>
</li>
<li><div class="first">
Since we are almost on the beach, we can take one day off for summer
relaxation and/or tourist visits nearby :-).</div>
</li>
</ul>

Genova-Pegli, Italy.  Pegli is a nice and peaceful little quarter of Genova,
and the hotel is directly on the beach, making it a perfect place for those
who want to enjoy the sea in the middle of the Italian summer, as a quick
<a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=genova%20pegli">search</a> on Google Images shows :-)<br>
<br>
The place has a good ADSL Internet connexion with wireless installed.  You can
of course arrange your own lodging anywhere but I definitely recommend lodging
there too.<br>
Please <i>confirm</i> that you are coming so that we can adjust the reservations as
appropriate.  The prices are as follows, and they include breakfast and a
parking place for the car, in case you need it:<br>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>single room:  70 €</li>
<li>double room:  95 €</li>
<li>triple room: 105 €</li>

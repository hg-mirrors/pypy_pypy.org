<html><body><p>Well, if the answer of "How to make numpy available in pypy" is "do a complicated rewrite of numpy," then I'm pretty skeptical about the pypy project. I primarily use numpy, but also scipy sometimes and Image sometimes. As a user it's most important to me that code runs. Speed is not as critical. For example if I take stddev() of an array I first want that to run, and only secondarily want it efficient. If there's a library that I might want to use, and I can't expend a reasonable amount of effort to wrap it, or else someone else can do that, then I don't find pypy that encouraging at all. Since there are lots of libraries out there, and it has been convincingly argued that Python's primary utility is its library support.</p></body></html>

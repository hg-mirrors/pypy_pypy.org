<html><body><p>Here is a completely different approach taken by IronPython for Scipy+Numpy compatibility:<br><br>http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2009/03/19/ironclad-ironpytho/<br><br>It's basically a bidirectional FFI. Have a CPython and an IronPython both running, and wrap objects so that IronPython objects can be used by CPython and vice versa. This requires some platform specific binary level compatibility, in their case, DLL hacking, to allow the FFI to work in both directions.<br><br>It seems like that approach should be practical for getting all of large libraries such as Scipy or Numpy working in Pypy. Since it's already been demonstrated to work for IronPython.<br><br>The above roadmap proposes instead speeding up the core array object by coding it in RPython.<br><br>But I wonder if these two approaches could work together. For example Numpy could be configured to use ordinary CPython array objects, or PyPy compiled RPython array objects. Then the FFI just has to take care to wrap objects appropriately that are in the "other interpreter".<br><br>Thoughts?</p></body></html>

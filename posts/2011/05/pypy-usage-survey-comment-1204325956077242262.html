<html><body><p>On my server I'm running couple of Django based ecommerce systems. I hope to be running more of them soon (hopefully). There is also PostgreSQL. Still not using PyPy but I just can't wait to check if it will be faster and if so then how much. I don't know yet how to run Django app on production on PyPy but as soon I check and run couple of performance tests I will surely give some feedback.</p></body></html>

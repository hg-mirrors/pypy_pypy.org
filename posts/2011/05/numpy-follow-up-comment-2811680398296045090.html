<html><body><p>I like the idea of reimplementing part of Numpy in pypy to leverage the JIT in pypy. The existence of numexpr demonstrates the deficiency of Numpy as a Python library. A JIT is much more appropriate for what effectively should be a DSL.<br><br>But I would recommend something grander, perhaps for the longer term. I think if pypy could produce do for Python what McVM and McJIT propose to do for Matlab, it would be game-changing for Python and pypy. It would make pypy not only competitive with Matlab in ways that Numpy and Scipy are not yet and may never be, but also with F#. The rapid uptake of F# in financial industry in particular, despite the availability of Matlab, showcases the need for a fast prototyping language that does not rely on calling Fortran code for speed. I know I am looking for such language; Numpy and Python simply don't offer enough power and flexibility. I hope I can choose pypy.</p></body></html>

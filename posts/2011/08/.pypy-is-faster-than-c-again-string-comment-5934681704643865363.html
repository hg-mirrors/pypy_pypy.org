<html><body><p>So when are you going to teach PyPy that the result of an unused string formatting can be deleted, and then delete the loop?  ;)<br><br>I'm not sure how you'd get there from a tracing JIT, though.  WIth Python, you still have to call all the formatting and stringification methods because they might have side effects.  You only get to know that the entire operation is a no-op after you've inlined everything, but by then it will be at a low enough representation that it's hard to tell.</p></body></html>

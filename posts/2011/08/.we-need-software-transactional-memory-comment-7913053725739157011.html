<html><body><p>@Sam Wilson: as you know, the PyPy approach is to sacrifice nothing to performance for the user, and get reasonably good (if not exactly Java-level) performance anyway :-)<br><br>I should also mention generally that for some programs that I have in mind, using a message-passing API would be a complete rewrite (if it is really possible at all), whereas "just" making them multithreaded can be done.  The "translate.py" of PyPy falls into this category.  It is a program that heavily use objects within objects within objects in a big non-nicely-separable "mess", and I would not dare to think about how to send parts of this object graph over a messaging API and get back localized updates.<br><br>Of course there are also other use cases where you can naturally get a model that plays nicely with message passing.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>Hi,<br><br>nice result.  Wrapping C++ code can be even more tiresome than C, especially with large code bases.  This will be a very welcome tool.<br><br><br>This question has probably been answered before... but I ask anyway since I couldn't find the answer.<br><br>Can the jit information be saved, so it does not need to be worked out again?  Assuming all of the dependencies have not changed (.py files, pypy itself, .so files etc).  Maybe if location independent code can not be saved, then trace hints or some higher level structure could be saved to inform the jit about what traces to jit?  That sounds like a solution to jit warm up for code that is used repeatedly.<br><br>cu.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>This is a horribly flawed benchmark which illustrates absolutely nothing. First of all, an optimizing JIT should be (easily) able to detect that your inner loop has no side effects and optimize it away. Secondly, with code like that you should expect all kinds of weirds transformations by the compiler, hence - you can't be really sure what you are comparing here. As many here have pointed out, you should compare the output assembly.<br><br>Anyway, if you really want to do a benchmark like that, do it the right way. Make the loop grow a string by continuous appending and write the string to the file in the end (time the loop only). This way you will get accurate results which really compare the performance of two compilers performing the same task.</p></body></html>

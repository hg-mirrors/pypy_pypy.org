<html><body><p>Hi,<br><br>thanks! :)<br><br>There was a recent thread on saving JIT information on pypy-dev:<br><br>http://mail.python.org/pipermail/pypy-dev/2011-August/008073.html<br><br>and the conclusion there was that it is too hard to be of benefit because too many parts contain addresses or calculated variables that were turned into constants.<br><br>For our (HEP) purposes, it would be of limited benefit: in the development cycle, the .py's would change all the time, and it is a safe assumption that the user codes that are being developed are the most "hot." If there is anything in the supporting code that is "hot" (most likely in the framework) it'd be in C/C++ at that point anyway.<br><br>Rather, I'd like to have an easy way of letting the user determine which portions of the code will be hot. Saving not having to run a hot loop 1000x in interpreted mode before the JIT kicks in, is going to be more valuable in scientific codes where the hot loops tend to be blatantly obvious.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Wim</p></body></html>

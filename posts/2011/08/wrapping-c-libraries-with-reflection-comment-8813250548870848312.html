<html><body><p>Hi,<br><br>thanks! :)<br><br>ad 1) it's not at the level of being usable in a production environment. I have two known issues to resolve and probably some more unknowns. I've posted a description on pypy-dev, and I'm helping a few patient, very friendly users along. But actual documentation suggest a level of support that currently can't be offered, because all the current (and soon to disappear) caveats would need documenting as well.<br><br>ad 2) not sure what data translation you're thinking of, but in the CPython equivalent, support was added for the buffer interface and MemoryView. Those, or something similar, will be there so that numpy array's etc. can be build from return values, from public data members, and passed into function calls as arguments. Those are not translations, but rather extraction of the data pointers (which is typically intended and the most efficient, to be sure).<br><br>Cheers,<br>Wim</p></body></html>

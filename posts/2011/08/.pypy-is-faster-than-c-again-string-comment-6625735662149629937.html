<html><body><p>What performance impact does the malloc/free produce in the C code? AFAIK Python allocates memory in larger chunks from the operating system. Probably Python does not have to call malloc after initialization after it allocated the first chunk.<br><br>AFAIK each malloc/free crosses the boundaries between user-mode/kernel-mode.<br><br>So, IMHO you should compare the numbers of a C program which<br>does not allocate dynamic memory more than once and uses an internal memory management system.<br><br>These numbers would be interesting.<br><br>Have fun</p></body></html>

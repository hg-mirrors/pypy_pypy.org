<html><body><p>Well over a year ago, <a class="reference external" href="http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2010/07/cern-sprint-report-wrapping-c-libraries.html">work was started</a> on the <tt class="docutils literal">cppyy</tt> module which lives in the
<tt class="docutils literal">reflex-support</tt> branch.
Since then, work has progressed at a varying pace and has included a recent
sprint in Düsseldorf, last July.</p>
<p>Let's first take a step back and recap why we're interested in doing this,
given that it is perfectly possible to use C++ through generated bindings and
<tt class="docutils literal">cpyext</tt>.
<tt class="docutils literal">cppyy</tt> makes use of reflection information generated for the C++ classes of
interest, and has that reflection information available at run time.
Therefore, it is able to open up complex C++ types to the JIT in a
conceptually similar manner as simple types are open to it.
This means that it is possible to get rid of a lot of the marshalling layers
when making cross-language calls, resulting in much lower call overhead than
is possible when going through the CPython API, or other methods of wrapping.</p>
<p>There are two problems that need to be solved: C++ language constructs need to
be presented on the Python side in a natural way; and cross-language impedance
mismatches need to be minimized, with some hints of the user if need be.
For the former, the list of mapped features has grown to a set that is
sufficient to do real work.
There is now support for:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>builtin, pointer, and array types</li>
<li>namespaces, classes, and inner classes</li>
<li>global functions, global data</li>
<li>static/instance data members and methods</li>
<li>default variables, object return by value</li>
<li>single and multiple (virtual) inheritance</li>
<li>templated classes</li>
<li>basic STL support and pythonizations</li>
<li>basic (non-global) operator mapping</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The second problem is harder and will always be an on-going process.
But one of the more important issues has been solved at the recent Düsseldorf
sprint, namely, that of reclaiming C++ objects instantiated from the Python
side by the garbage collector.</p>
<p>Performance has also improved, especially that of the nicer "pythonized"
interface that the user actually sees, although it still misses out on
about a factor of 2.5 in comparison to the lower-level interface (which has
gotten uglier, so you really don't want to use that).
Most of this improvement is due to restructuring so that it plays nicer with
the JIT and libffi, both of which themselves have seen improvements.</p>
<p>Work is currently concentrated on the back-ends: a <a class="reference external" href="http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/cint">CINT</a> back-end is underway
and a LLVM/CLang pre-compiled headers (PCH) back-end is planned.
The latter is needed for this code to be released in the wild, rather than
just used in high energy physics (HEP), as that would be easier to support.
Also, within HEP, CLang's PCH are foreseen to be the future format of
reflection information.</p>
<p>At the end of the Düsseldorf sprint, we tried a little code that did something
actually "useful," namely the filling of a histogram with some random values.
We did get it to work, but trying <tt class="docutils literal">cppyy</tt> on a large class library showed
that a good warning system for such things like missing classes was sorely
needed.
That has been added since, and revisiting the histogram example later, here is
an interesting note: the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pypy-c</span></tt> run takes 1.5x the amount of time of that
of the compiled, optimized, C++ code.
The run was timed start to finish, including the reflection library loading
and JIT warm-up that is needed in the case of Python, but not for the compiled
C++ code.
However, in HEP, scientists run many short jobs while developing their
analysis codes, before submitting larger jobs on the GRID to run during lunch
time or overnight.
Thus, a more realistic comparison is to include the compilation time needed
for the C++ code and with that, the Python code needs only 55% of the time
required by C++.</p>
<p>The choice of a programming language is often a personal one, and such
arguments like the idea that C++ is hard to use typically do not carry much
weight with the in-crowd that studies quantum field dynamics for fun.
However, getting the prompt with your analysis results back faster is a sure
winner. We hope that <tt class="docutils literal">cppyy</tt> will soon have progressed far enough to make it
useful first to particle physicists and then other uses for wrapping C++
libraries.</p>

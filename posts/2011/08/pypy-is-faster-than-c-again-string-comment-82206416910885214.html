<html><body><p>@Antiplutocrat:<br>Honestly, I expected a bit more objectivity from posters here. I am really disappointed that you compare me to "haters" (whoever that may be). <br><br>Your point about unroll-if-alt is absolutely valid and I myself have explicitly stated that I did not use that feature. At no point I have refuted that the original blog post was wrong - it is still very well possible that PyPy 1.6 is faster then C in this usage scenario. The main goal of my post was to make clear that the original benchmarks were flawed, as they grant the compiler too much  space for unpredictable optimizations. I believe that my benchmark code produces more realistic results and I suggest that the authors of this blog entry re-run the benchmark using my code (or something similar, which controls for unpredictable optimizations).</p></body></html>

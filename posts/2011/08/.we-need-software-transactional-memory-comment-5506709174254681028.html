<html><body><p>⚛, you're missing a very important bit of the paper. In it, the authors say, that the Rock hardware only holds 256 bytes of write-buffer content, while Riley and Zilles¹ determined the average write-buffer size needed for transactions to not fail prematurely would be "less than 640 bytes", which is almost three times as much as Rock offers.<br><br>Thus, the big slowdown that the pystone benchmark experiences could be caused by the shortcomings of the TM built into Rock.<br><br>I do have to agree, though, that the "benchmarks" used in the paper are not very satisfactory. However, the magical "simple parallelization algorithm" you summon in your comment would break down quite easily shortly after the complexity of the situation increases by just a bit, would it not?<br><br>¹ I only briefly glanced over the paper, so if anyone read it more thoroughly, they can feel free to correct me.</p></body></html>

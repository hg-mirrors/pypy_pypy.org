<html><body><p>The high-level semantics that the Python VM provides through the GIL are perfect for most programs, and for most programmer's knowledge about concurrency.<br><br>What is the purpose of going after the GIL? <br><br>If it's just a performance boost on multiple cores, then an GIOL (global IO lock) implemented on the VM, as the GIL is, should be considered. The VM could run several OS threads blocking them on IO and releasing GIL.<br><br>If the purpose is to make concurrent programming easy and correct, it can be proven that it <b>is not possible</b>.<br><br>Yet, there are alternatives that don't alter the language or the semantics that can be explored. <br><br>Erlang-style message passing can be provided through object proxies implemented on top or beneath the VM, so the threads/processes can even run on different computers.<br><br>In short, an Actor model is much preferable to a shared-memory one.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model</p></body></html>

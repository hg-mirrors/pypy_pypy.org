<html><body><p>a quick tip to minimize the math in determining your sprintf buffer size for your experiment:<br>#include &lt; stdint.h &gt;<br>len = snprintf(NULL, 0, "%d %d", INT32_MIN, INT32_MIN);<br>will give you the string length required (not including null terminating byte) to fit the formatted string.<br><br>Similarly, %lld and INT64_MIN will do the trick (on the right platform) for 64-bit signed integers.<br><br>(not that I advocate fixed sized buffers for formatted strings based on min/max digit lengths for any real application)</p></body></html>

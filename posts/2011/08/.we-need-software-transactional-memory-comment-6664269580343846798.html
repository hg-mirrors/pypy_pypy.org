<html><body><p>Seems like it should be possible to guarantee performance not much worse than with a GIL.<br><br>Am I right in thinking there is a locked section where changes are written to memory? The execution before this is effectively just some speculative computation to to speed up the locked section. If it turns out there's an inconsistency, just execute the locked section as you would normally. If the speculative computation is failing most of the time or is slow, switch to not doing it -- and we are back to GIL performance.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>@Anonymous: this branch, unroll-if-alt, will not be included in the release 1.6, which we're doing right now (it should be out any day now).  It will only be included in the next release, which we hope to do soonish.  It will also be in the nightly builds as soon as it is merged.</p></body></html>

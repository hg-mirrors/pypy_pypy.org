<html><body><p>This is great. I have been looking for just such a tool to wrap C++ numerical code.<br><br>I guess I have two questions:<br>1. Is there any documentation on how to use it?<br>2. It is very important to be able to translate between NumPy data structure and C++ data structure for me, so is there any plan to make this easy?<br><br>Thanks for great work.</p></body></html>

Claims about compiler or language X winning over Y should be made after observing patterns in real programs. That is: execute or analyse real C programs which are making use of 'sprintf', record their use of 'sprintf', create a statistics out of the recorded data and then finally use the statistical distributions to create Python programs with a similar distribution of calls to '%'.<br><br>Trivial microbenchmarks can be deceiving.</p></body></html>

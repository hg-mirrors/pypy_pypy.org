<html><body><p>I'm still most looking forward to the day your jit makes some .pyj files. Initialization time for the jit is a bit high, especially if you use pypy integrated into other scripts where the init time might impact performance, numpy had no dtypes, and laked almost every function, but atleast it's a step in the right direction :)<br><br>Memory usage for one of my own test apps (building a one dimensional dict with int keys, and object (sometimes by reference from a second dict) resulted in 76MB to python2.7 and 108MB to pypy 1.6. So memory usage is still a bit behind tho (the pypy runtime was better with around 35% tho).</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>@JoeHillen: the unroll-if-alt branch is inside the main pypy repo on bitbucket (together with all the other branches).<br><br>@Greg: yes, we checked the generated code, it's not optimized away.<br><br>@anonymous: why it should be any faster? String literals in C are constants, it's not that you need to create a new one at each iteration<br><br>@Johan: note that the PyPy approach can generate code optimized for a formatting string loaded from a disk, or computed at runtime. No static compiler could do that.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>String formatting is probably something you do just about every day in Python,
and never think about.  It's so easy, just <tt class="docutils literal">"%d %d" % (i, i)</tt> and you're
done.  No thinking about how to size your result buffer, whether your output
has an appropriate NULL byte at the end, or any other details.  A C
equivalent might be:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
char x[44];
sprintf(x, "%d %d", i, i);
</pre>
<p>Note that we had to stop for a second and consider how big numbers might get
and overestimate the size (44 = length of the biggest number on 64bit (20) +
1 for the sign * 2 + 1 (for the space) + 1 (NUL byte)), it took the authors of
this post, fijal and alex, 3 tries to get the math right on this :-)</p>
<p>This is fine, except you can't even return <tt class="docutils literal">x</tt> from this function, a more
fair comparison might be:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
char *x = malloc(44 * sizeof(char));
sprintf(x, "%d %d", i, i);
</pre>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">x</tt> is slightly overallocated in some situations, but that's fine.</p>
<p>But we're not here to just discuss the implementation of string
formatting, we're here to discuss how blazing fast PyPy is at it, with
the new <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">unroll-if-alt</span></tt> branch.  Given the Python code:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def main():
    for i in xrange(10000000):
        "%d %d" % (i, i)

main()
</pre>
<p>and the C code:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;


int main() {
    int i = 0;
    char x[44];
    for (i = 0; i &lt; 10000000; i++) {
        sprintf(x, "%d %d", i, i);
    }
}
</pre>
<p>Run under PyPy, at the head of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">unroll-if-alt</span></tt> branch, and
compiled with GCC 4.5.2 at -O4 (other optimization levels were tested,
this produced the best performance). It took <strong>0.85</strong> seconds to
execute under PyPy, and <strong>1.63</strong> seconds with the compiled binary. We
think this demonstrates the incredible potential of dynamic
compilation, GCC is unable to inline or unroll the <tt class="docutils literal">sprintf</tt> call,
because it sits inside of libc.</p>
<p>Benchmarking the C code:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;


int main() {
    int i = 0;
    for (i = 0; i &lt; 10000000; i++) {
        char *x = malloc(44 * sizeof(char));
        sprintf(x, "%d %d", i, i);
        free(x);
    }
}
</pre>
<p>Which as discussed above, is more comperable to the Python, gives a
result of <strong>1.96</strong> seconds.</p>
<p>Summary of performance:</p>

<p>Overall PyPy is almost <strong>2x</strong> faster. This is clearly win for dynamic
compilation over static - the <cite>sprintf</cite> function lives in libc and so
cannot be specializing over the constant string, which has to be parsed
every time it's executed. In the case of PyPy, we specialize
the assembler if we detect the left hand string of the modulo operator
to be constant.</p>

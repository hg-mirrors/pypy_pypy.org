<html><body><p>Funny to see how Python eats itself like an Ouroboros. Wrong design decisions that made concurrency almost impossible, dirty hacks ("dirty" compared to, for example, Erlang's approach to SMP â€” almost linear scalability with a number of cores with 10-20% static overhead thanks to locks) that PyPy team are trying to do to solve problems introduced by Guido's ignorance, and a lot of Python "programmers" that don't understand what SMP is. Python is a ghetto, for real.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>@Armin: Each in-memory process would use its own part of the heap so there would be no locking necessary except during message sending.  You also don't need to have a 1-to-1 mapping of OS threads to processes.  You could schedule N processes onto M OS threads (preferably chosen to match the number of CPU cores).<br><br>Of course, if you don't want a message-passing model (as you mentioned in another comment) then fine.<br><br>My argument is just that: STM is difficult to implement, difficult to make fast, and it still isn't that easy to use.  A message passing model is much easier to implement and easier to use for end users.  (You can still get deadlocks, but you could provide libraries for standard communication patterns which you only have to get right once, like Erlang's OTP.)</p></body></html>

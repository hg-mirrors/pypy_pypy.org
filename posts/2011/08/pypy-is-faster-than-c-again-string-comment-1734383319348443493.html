<html><body><p>@Andrew, @hobbs: Oh, sorry I overlooked the "s" in "sprintf".  It would still be nice compare the generated machine code to explain the differences.<br><br>Whenever, someone claims language L1 implementation A is faster than language L2 implementation B there are obvious questions about (1) fairness of comparison, (2) what is being measured.  In this case PyPy is specializing on the format string interpreter (does that require library annotations?) which a C compiler could do in principle here (but probably doesn't.)  So, I'm always a bit suspicious when I see these kinds of comparisons.<br><br>@Johan: GHC's cross-module optimization often comes at the expense of binary compatibility.  A JIT has a big advantage here.</p></body></html>

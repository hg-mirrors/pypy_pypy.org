<html><body><p>Hi,<br><br>I thought a bit about what you said about Jython. Mostly, I was thinking about a way to do this automatically instead of making it explicitly.<br><br>I came up with this first draft: https://github.com/albertz/automatic_object_locking<br><br>This will obviously also be very slow but it should be possible to optimize this well (similarly to STM). And I think it is much easier than STM.<br><br>-Albert</p></body></html>

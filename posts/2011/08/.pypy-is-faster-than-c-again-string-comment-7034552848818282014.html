<html><body><p>Well, I never said anything about writing super efficient C code. Anyway, I don't see how you want to implement string formatting more efficiently  - if we talk about general usage scenario. You can't really reuse the old string buffer, you basically have to allocate new one each time the string grows. Or pre-allocate a larger string buffer and do some substring copies (which will result in a much more complicated code). Anyway, the malloc() on OS X is very fast.<br><br>My point is: even this C code, which you call inefficient is around 6 times faster then pypy 1.5</p></body></html>

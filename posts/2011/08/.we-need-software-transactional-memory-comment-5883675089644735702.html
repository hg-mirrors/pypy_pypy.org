<html><body><p>Implementing STM at a core level is certainly a nice research topic, but I wonder whether it's the best way forward for Python.<br><br>STM works well in Haskell because it has the type system to enforce several constraints.  Also most data is immutable in Haskell, so threading is mostly safe by default.<br><br>Most Python objects are mutable (by default), so users have to be very careful when using multi-threading.  STM gives you a nice, composable primitive to protect your critical sections, but it does not tell <b>where</b> your critical sections are.<br><br>You dismiss multiprocessing because of serialization issues, but what about multiprocessing within the same process?  You have a VM already, so my guess would be that it wouldn't be that hard to implement software processes (a la Erlang).  Sure, using message passing may lead to a fair amount of copying, but I it seems to be much easier to implement and easier to use than shared-memory concurrency + STM.</p></body></html>

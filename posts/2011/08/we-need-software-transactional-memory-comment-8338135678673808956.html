<html><body><p>Re sys calls in transactions:<br><br>In clojure it is solved by requiring that code in transaction is side effect free.<br><br>You can tag code as having side effects by macro "io!" :<br><br>(defn launch-missiles<br>“Launch attack on remote targets with everything we have.”<br>[]<br>(io!<br>(doseq [missile (all-silos)]<br>(fire missile))))<br><br>Then if you try to execut this code in transaction clojure will complain, because you can't really rollback launching nuclear missiles :)</p></body></html>

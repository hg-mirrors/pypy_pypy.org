<html><body><p>@âš›: you're sitting in your own corner of the world thinking that we will try hard to figure out which segfault you could possibly mean, and that it will help the PyPy project :-)  I've heard many misconceptions of how Open Source works, but I've never heard this one.<br><br>How it really works is: you think you have a genuine segfault and want to report it, in which case you file a bug to http://bugs.pypy.org, and maybe we have to discuss more to figure out why, for example, it appears on your machine and not ours, or which configuration you need to reproduce it; sometimes it can take efforts on both parties to even reproduce the problem.<br><br>You are free to not play this game, but then just like Maciej said, you will be fully ignored.  Even if it's a real bug, it's likely that over time someone else will report or fix it.  I'm not trying to force you to "reveal" it to us; feel free to ignore me.  I'm just explaining how I believe Open Source works.<br><br>The difference for us is small, because a real bug will be seen and reported by others too.  The difference for you is whether you would like to contribute and get our thanks, or don't care about it.</p></body></html>

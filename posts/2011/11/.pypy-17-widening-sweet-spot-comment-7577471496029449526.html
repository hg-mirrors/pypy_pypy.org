<html><body><p>@Jorgen and @Maciej:<br><br>Well, I previously wrote here that "The question is what measures are you (=the PyPy team) going to take to solve this PyPy issue."<br><br>This sentence of mine contained the additional information that: I believe that it is a PyPy issue.<br><br>Maciej then wrote: "Most probably you're using a CPython C extension or ... that did that or something". This means he was trying to put the blame on others (C extensions or whatever) rather than admitting that it might be an issue attributable to PyPy and PyPy alone.<br><br>Then you (Jorgen) wrote "So you want to conduct an experiment into 'How to help out an open source project by withholding crucial information'?". And that is exactly what I intend to do: to help the PyPy project by withholding crucial information.<br><br>It will work.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>@Winston:<br><br>astutely observed (as always). There are two points to string lists: <br><br>1) PyPy's strings have one extra indirection, e.g. the data is not stored in the string box. This is due to RPython restrictions. With string lists, one indirection can be removed.<br><br>2) If the JIT knows that the full list stores only strings, it can actually generate better code, because it does not need to check the type of the item that was just read out of the list.</p></body></html>

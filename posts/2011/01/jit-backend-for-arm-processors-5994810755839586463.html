In the past few months, I have been developing as a part of my master thesis
the ARM backend for the the PyPy JIT, in the <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/src/arm-backend-2">arm-backend</a> branch. Currently, it is still work in progress: all integer and object operations are working and
the support for <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/src/arm-backed-float">floating point</a> is also under development.<br>
ARM processors are very widely used, beeing deployed in servers, some netbooks
and mainly mobile devices such as phones and tablets. One of our goals is to be
able to run PyPy on phones, specially on Android. Currently is not yet possible
to translate and compile PyPy for Android automatically, but there has been
some <a class="reference external" href="http://pyppet.blogspot.com/2011/01/android-and-rpython.html">work</a>  on using Android's NDK to compile PyPy's generated C code.<br>
The JIT Backend targets the application profile of the ARMv7 instruction set
architecture which is found for example in the Cortex-A8 processors used in many Android powered devices and in Apple's <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_A4">A4 processors</a> built into the latest iOS devices. To develop and
test the backend we are using a <a class="reference external" href="http://beagleboard.org/hardware-xM">BeagleBoard-xM</a> which has a 1 GHz ARM
Cortex-A8 and 512 MB of RAM running the <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ARM">ARM port</a> of Ubuntu 10.10.<br>
Currently on Linux it is possible to translate and cross-compile PyPy's Python
interpreter as well as other interpreters with the ARM JIT backend enabled
using Scratchbox 2 to provide a build environment and the GNU ARM cross
compilation toolchain. So far the backend only supports the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/">Boehm</a> garbage
collector which does not produce the best results combined with the JIT, but we
plan to add support for the other GCs in the future, doing so should increase
the performance of PyPy on ARM.<br>
While still debugging the last issues with the backend we already can run some
simple benchmarks on <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/cfbolz/pyrolog">Pyrolog</a>, a prolog interpreter written in RPython.
Even using Boehm as the GC the results look very promising. In the benchmarks
we compare Pyrolog to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/">SWI-Prolog</a>, a prolog interpreter written in C, which
is available from the package repositories for Ubuntu's ARM port.<br>
The benchmarks can be found in the <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/cfbolz/pyrolog-benchmark">pyrolog-bench</a> repository.<br>

The iterate_call benchmark, which constructs a predicate and calls it at
runtime, with a speedup of 662 times over SWI-Prolog is an example where the
JIT can show its strength. The Pyrolog interpreter and the JIT treat
dynamically defined predicates as static ones and can generate optimezed code
in both cases. Whereas SWI only compiles statically defined rules and has to
fall back to interpretation on dynamic ones.<br>
For simple benchmarks running on PyPy's Python intepreter we see some speedups
over CPython, but we still need to debug the backend bit more before we can
show numbers on more complex benchmarks. So, stay tuned.</div></body></html>

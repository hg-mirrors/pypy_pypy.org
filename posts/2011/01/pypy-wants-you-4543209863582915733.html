<p>If you ever considered contributing to PyPy, but never did so far, this is a
good moment to start! :-)</p>
<p>Recently, we merged the <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/changeset/9317ec76d9eb">fast-forward</a> branch which brings Python 2.7
compatibility, with the plan of releasing a new version of PyPy as soon as all
tests pass.</p>
<p>However, at the moment there are still quite a few of <a class="reference external" href="http://buildbot.pypy.org/summary?branch=%3Ctrunk%3E">failing tests</a> because
of new 2.7 features that have not been implemented yet: many of them are easy
to fix, and doing it represents a good way to get confidence with the code
base, for those who are interested in it. Michael Foord wrote a little <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/wiki/How%20to%20run%20lib-python%20tests">howto</a>
explaining the workflow for running lib-python tests.</p>
<p>Thus, if you are willing to join us in the effort of having a PyPy compatible
with Python 2.7, probably the most sensible option is to come on the #PyPy IRC
channel on Freenode, so we can coordinate each other not to fix the same test
twice.</p>
<p>Moreover, if you are a student and are considering participating in the next
<a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Google Summer of Code</a> this is a good time to get into pypy. You have the
opportunity to get a good understanding of pypy for when you decide what you
would like to work on over the summer.</p></body></html>

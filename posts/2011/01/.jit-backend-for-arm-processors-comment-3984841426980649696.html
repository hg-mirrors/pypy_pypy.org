This benchmark is clearly not about how fast Pyrolog is, but how the ARM JIT backend performs, using trivial Prolog microbenchmarks, with SWI to give a number to compare against.<br><br>Pyrolog is a minimal Prolog implementation that is (at least so far) mostly an experiment to see how well PyPy's JIT technology can do on an non-imperative language.

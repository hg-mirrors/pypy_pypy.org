<html><body><p>Martijn: you are describing the situation as well as we (at least I) know it so far: while PyPy has in many cases a lower non-JIT memory usage, the JIT adds some overhead.  But it seems to be within ~200MB on "pypy translate.py", which is kind of the extreme example in hugeness.  So already on today's high-end boards with 1GB of RAM, it should easily fit.  Moreover it can be tweaked, e.g. it's probably better on these systems to increase the threshold at which JITting starts (which also reduces the number of JITted code paths).  So I think that the possibility is real.</p></body></html>

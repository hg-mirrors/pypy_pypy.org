Perhaps it would be harder to place the hints for the jit engine?<br><br>As far as I understand it, it still traces some kind of bytecode (generated from the RPython code), but uses the can_enter_jit hints to determine what to trace and the length of a trace.<br><br>If it'll be fast is another question though. Why not give it a try? (E.g. one could implement the LLVM kaleidoscope language in RPython.)</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>The next PyPy sprint will be in Gothenburg, Sweden. It is a public sprint,
very suitable for newcomers.  We'll focus on making the 1.5 release (if
it hasn't already happened) and whatever interests the Sprint attendees.</p>
<div class="section" id="topics-and-goals">
<h2>Topics and goals</h2>
<p>The main goal is to polish and release PyPy 1.5, supporting Python 2.7
as well as the last few months' improvements in the JIT (provided that
it hasn't already happened).  Other topics:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Going over our documentation, and classifying our docs in terms of
mouldiness.  Deciding what needs writing, and maybe writing it.</li>
<li>Helping people get their code running with PyPy</li>
<li>maybe work on EuroPython Training, and talks</li>
<li>Summer of Code preparation</li>
<li>speed.pypy.org</li>
<li>any other programming task is welcome too -- e.g. tweaking the
Python or JavaScript interpreter, Stackless support, and so on.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="location">
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The sprint will be held in the apartment of Laura Creighton and Jacob Hallén
which is at Götabergsgatan 22 in Gothenburg, Sweden.  Here is a <a class="reference external" href="http://bit.ly/grRuQe">map</a>.  This is
in central Gothenburg.  It is between the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.vasttrafik.se/en/">tram</a> stops of Vasaplatsen and
Valand, (a distance of 4 blocks) where many lines call -- the 2, 3, 4, 5,
7, 10 and 13.</p>
<p>Probably cheapest and not too far away is to book accomodation at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sgsveckobostader.se/en">SGS
Veckobostader</a>. The  <a class="reference external" href="http://www.elite.se/hotell/goteborg/park/">Elite Park Avenyn Hotel</a> is a luxury hotel just a
few blocks away. There are scores of hotels a short walk away from the
sprint location, suitable for every budget, desire for luxury, and desire
for the unusual.  You could, for instance, stay on a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.liseberg.se/en/home/Accommodation/Hotel/Hotel-Barken-Viking/">boat</a>.  Options are
too numerous to go into here. Just ask in the mailing list or on the blog.</p>
<p>Hours will be
from 10:00 until people have had enough.  It's a good idea to arrive a
day before the sprint starts and leave a day later.  In the middle of
the sprint there usually is a break day and it's usually ok to take
half-days off if you feel like it.</p>

<h2>Good to Know</h2>
<p>Sweden is not part of the Euro zone. One SEK (krona in singular, kronor
in plural) is roughly 1/10th of a Euro (9.36 SEK to 1 Euro).</p>
<p>The venue is central in Gothenburg.  There is a large selection of
places to get food nearby, from edible-and-cheap to outstanding.  We
often cook meals together, so let us know if you have any food allergies,
dislikes, or special requirements.</p>
<p>Sweden uses the same kind of plugs as Germany. 230V AC.</p>
<p>The Sprint will be held the week following Easter.  This means, as always,
that <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gothcon.se/">Gothcon</a> will be taking place the weekend before (Easter weekend).
Gothcon, now in its 35 year, is the largest European game players conference.
Some of you may be interested in arriving early for the board games.
The conference site is only in Swedish, alas.  You don't need to register
in advance unless you are planning to host a tournament, (and it's too
late for that anyway).</p>

<div class="section" id="getting-here">
<h2>Getting Here</h2>
<p>If are coming train, you will arrive at the <a class="reference external" href="http://bit.ly/fON43p">Central Station</a>.  It is
about 12 blocks to the site from there, or you can take a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.vasttrafik.se/en/">tram</a>.</p>
<p>There are two airports which are local to Göteborg, <a class="reference external" href="http://swedavia.se/en/Goteborg/Traveller-information/Traffic-information/">Landvetter</a> (the main
one) and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.goteborgairport.se/eng.asp">Gothenburg City Airport</a> (where some budget airlines fly).
If you arrive at <a class="reference external" href="http://swedavia.se/en/Goteborg/Traveller-information/Traffic-information/">Landvetter</a>  the airport bus stops right downtown at
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.elite.se/hotell/goteborg/park/">Elite Park Avenyn Hotel</a> which is the second stop, 4 blocks from the
Sprint site, as well as the end of the line, which is the <a class="reference external" href="http://bit.ly/fON43p">Central Station</a>.
If you arrive at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.goteborgairport.se/eng.asp">Gothenburg City Airport</a> take the bus to the end of the
line.  You will be at the  <a class="reference external" href="http://bit.ly/fON43p">Central Station</a>.</p>
<p>You can also arrive by <a class="reference external" href="http://www.stenaline.nl/en/ferry/">ferry</a>, from either Kiel in Germany or Frederikshavn
in Denmark.</p>

<html><body><p>We're pleased to announce the 1.5 release of PyPy. This release updates
PyPy with the features of CPython 2.7.1, including the standard library. Thus
all the features of <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/dev/whatsnew/2.6.html">CPython 2.6</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/dev/whatsnew/2.7.html">CPython 2.7</a> are now supported. It
also contains additional performance improvements. You can download it here:</p>

<h2>What is PyPy?</h2>
<p>PyPy is a very compliant Python interpreter, almost a drop-in replacement for
CPython 2.7.1. It's fast (<a class="reference external" href="http://bit.ly/mbVWwJ">pypy 1.5 and cpython 2.6.2</a> performance comparison)
due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.</p>
<p>This release includes the features of CPython 2.6 and 2.7. It also includes a
large number of small improvements to the tracing JIT compiler. It supports
Intel machines running Linux 32/64 or Mac OS X.  Windows is beta (it roughly
works but a lot of small issues have not been fixed so far).  Windows 64 is
not yet supported.</p>
<p>Numerous speed achievements are described on <a class="reference external" href="http://morepypy.blogspot.com">our blog</a>. Normalized speed
charts comparing <a class="reference external" href="http://bit.ly/joPhHo">pypy 1.5 and pypy 1.4</a> as well as <a class="reference external" href="http://bit.ly/mbVWwJ">pypy 1.5 and cpython
2.6.2</a> are available on our benchmark website. The speed improvement over 1.4
seems to be around 25% on average.</p>

<h2>More highlights</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The largest change in PyPy's tracing JIT is adding support for <a class="reference external" href="http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2011/01/loop-invariant-code-motion.html">loop invariant
code motion</a>, which was mostly done by Håkan Ardö. This feature improves the
performance of tight loops doing numerical calculations.</li>
<li>The CPython extension module API has been improved and now supports many more
extensions. For information on which one are supported, please refer to our
<a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/compatibility/wiki/Home">compatibility wiki</a>.</li>
<li>These changes make it possible to support <a class="reference external" href="http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2011/04/using-tkinter-and-idle-with-pypy.html">Tkinter and IDLE</a>.</li>
<li>The <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/library/profile.html">cProfile</a> profiler is now working with the JIT. However, it skews the
performance in unstudied ways. Therefore it is not yet usable to analyze
subtle performance problems (the same is true for CPython of course).</li>
<li>There is an <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/alex_gaynor/pypy-postgresql">external fork</a> which includes an RPython version of the
<tt class="docutils literal">postgresql</tt>.  However, there are no prebuilt binaries for this.</li>
<li>Our developer documentation was moved to Sphinx and cleaned up.</li>
<li>and many small things :-)</li>
</ul>

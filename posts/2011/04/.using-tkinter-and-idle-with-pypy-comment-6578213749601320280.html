<html><body><p>@Joaquin:<br>indeed, ez_setup seems not to work on windows. It might be related to this, although I did not investigate further:<br>https://bugs.pypy.org/issue725<br><br>Instead of ez_setup, you can try to follow these instructions and install distribute/pip, which we recommend anyway nowadays:<br>http://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/getting-started.html#installing-pypy<br><br>Note however that tkinter-pypy is not precompiled for windows, so you need to have the necessary developer tools installed.  If you manage to build a precompiled binary of tkinter-pypy, I'd be happy to put it in pypi :-)</p></body></html>

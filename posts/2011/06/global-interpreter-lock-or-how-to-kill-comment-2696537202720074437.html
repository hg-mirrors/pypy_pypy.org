<html><body><p>@Richard: reading the web page you point out, Microsoft's STM attempt (like most others I'm aware of) seems to work at a different level: basically as a library for application programmers.  I can go through all 4 points and show why they are not relevant in our context:<br><br>* any visible I/O (e.g. writing to a file or a log) is going to end the transaction and start the next one, just like the GIL is released and re-acquired around most calls to the C library's write() function<br><br>* the 2nd issue is moot, because STM will be an internal detail in PyPy, not a user-visible feature<br><br>* the 3nd issue he describes is about "update-in-place" STM, which I believe is not the best solution: we want instead to keep a local log of the changes, and apply them only at commit-time (as described e.g. in the paper I pointed out)<br><br>* the final issue is the lack of real successes with STM.  Well, we can't do anything about that ahead of time :-)</p></body></html>

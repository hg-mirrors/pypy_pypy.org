<html><body><p>@Michael Foord: STM definitely can be made as fine-grained as you like. Some existing STM systems operate at the level of machine words. Given that this one will be operating at the interpreter level, I would guess that code working on different sections of the same object (or array) would able to run in parallel, but I guess it depends on how the tradeoffs play out.</p></body></html>

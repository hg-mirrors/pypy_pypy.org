<html><body><p>@âš› The line might be blurry, but "I'm using PyPy for X" or "I'm not using PyPy for X, because ..." is on topic. While "Python can be used for X" or "Python can't be used for X, because ..." is not on topic. This is a fine line between language implementation (which is PyPy about) and language design (which PyPy is not about, python-dev/python-list/python-ideas mailing lists are about that).<br><br>Cheers,<br>fijal</p></body></html>

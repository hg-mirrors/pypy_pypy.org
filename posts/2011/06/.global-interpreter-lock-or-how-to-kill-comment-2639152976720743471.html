<html><body><p>@âš›: to complete Ben's answer: yes, you are correct, but that's why the translation step "insert STM logic" is never going to be mandatory.  You will get either a regular pypy-c-gil or a pypy-c-stm, as two different executables, and you will choose the one most suited for your particular program.  I still expect pypy-c-gil to be the most used one, with pypy-c-stm an alternative that is only useful for people with massively multi-threaded programs.</p></body></html>

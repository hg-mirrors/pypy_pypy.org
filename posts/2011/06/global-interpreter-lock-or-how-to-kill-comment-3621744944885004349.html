<html><body><p>I love this idea.<br><br>Just musing on an implementation detail here, but isn't the "lazy" STM implementation's transaction system effectively just an in-memory implementation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write" rel="nofollow">copy-on-write</a> semantics? It might be interesting to take a look at other things that have used COW for inspiration. (ZFS and btrfs come to mind) I like the idea that committing a transaction for a given object would just involve changing the object's address in memory to the modified copy.<br><br>Also, I'd be interested to see the read/write lock system get implemented, because it seems like it might be a better choice for programs that only use a couple threads.</p></body></html>

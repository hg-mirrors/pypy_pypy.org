<html><body><p>Interesting idea, but some questions:<br>1. What do C extensions do? (extensions designed for CPython that are using GIL methods).  Would they still be able to be used, or would they have to be rewritten for PyPy?<br><br>2. What happens if repeatable operations are interleaved with operations that are not repeatable? (e.g. logging values to a file - we wouldn't want it to happen twice if there was a conflict, unless of course you are using that logging to trace what is happening...).</p></body></html>

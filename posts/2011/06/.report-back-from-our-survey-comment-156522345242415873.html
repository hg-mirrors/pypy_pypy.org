<html><body><p>@Marko Tasic: If I may ask a question. You wrote that you are using PyPy for highly reliable systems. I know what you mean, but it seems to me that certain features of Python are in contradiction with high reliability. For example, it is in practice impossible to know at compile-time whether you misspelled a variable or parameter in Python source code. My question would be: why are you using a language which has only rudimentary compile-time error detection to implement a high reliability system?</p></body></html>

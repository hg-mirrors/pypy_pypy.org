<html><body><p>There's another simple case where pypy could (in principle) do very much better than standard C: turn pow(x, i) into sqrt(x*x*x) if i == 3/2, and other reductions.  In practice if you don't know what i is at compiletime you often bundle the simplifications into a function (at the cost of some ifs) but a JIT could do a very nice job on this automagically whenever i is fixed, which it usually is.</p></body></html>

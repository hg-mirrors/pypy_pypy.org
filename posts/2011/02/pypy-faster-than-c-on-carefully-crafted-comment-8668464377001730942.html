<html><body><p>@Eric This post is not trying to argue that Python is "better" or even faster than C. It is just pointing out that certain classes of optimizations (i.e. whole program optimizations) come naturally to the PyPy JIT.  <br><br>This is, of course, only one small facet of why a program runs fast. The author admits that it is a contrived example to illustrate the point.<br><br>Taking the point to an extreme, one could see a PyPy program run faster than a C program if the C program made many calls to simple shared libraries. For example, if one dynamically links a C stdlib into their program, and uses it heavily, the equivalent python code may conceivably run faster.</p></body></html>

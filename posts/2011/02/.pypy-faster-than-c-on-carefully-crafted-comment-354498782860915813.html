<html><body><p>Eric: Your comments about "real life" are irrelevant - the post is about a specific, contrived example. I don't think anyone would argue that a high-level, garbage-collected language like python could ever beat out C in general - it's simply a demonstration that, in a very specific instance, equivalent code in python and C can run faster in python because of the JIT making optimizations that can't occur at compile time.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>@Eric what you don't understand is the point of the article. The actual point is to demonstrate a nice property of PyPy JIT, which is able to generate fast code when it can. Comparing to C in this manner proves that PyPy's generated machine code is relevant with regard to speed.<br>Of course this example is fragile because it relies on suboptimal C code, but this serves only to prove the point about PyPy.</p></body></html>

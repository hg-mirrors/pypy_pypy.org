<html><body><p>You're right, people very often use dynamic linking. However the following is not a reasonable piece of Python code:<br><br>def add(a, b): return a + b<br><br>People rarely use that and more importantly they don't write a loop that calls it 1 billion times.<br><br>The point is that the reasoning spans two levels (hence is flawed/biased):<br>- in Python the author took a crafted piece of Python that is not meaningful in real life because it has the property to do what he wants at the Pypy level<br>- in C the author uses a very common mechanism that isn't fully optimized (not as much as Python/Ppy is optimized).<br><br>I know you will not agree since you're all proud that "Pypy is faster than C" (lol it's nonsense even on a "crafted example") but you have to compare apples with apples.</p></body></html>

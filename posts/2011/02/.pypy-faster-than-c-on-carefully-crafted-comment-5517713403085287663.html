<html><body><p>Please read the title of this article again: "<i>PyPy <b>faster than C</b> on a carefully crafted example</i>"<br><br>Based on a specific example or not it doesn't matter, I'm simply not comfortable with reading strong statement like this that are obvioulsy false to any serious computer scientist and misleading to beginners. It's false because it's the conclusion of a test which is biased.<br><br><b>The root of benchmarking is to get rid of any bias</b><br>In this case the obvious bias is that Pypy is optimized and C isn't (as demonstrated above with inline functions).<br><br>You can't transpose only what you want in real life and not the other: your argument that in real life the C could use external library hence be slower is valid, but then you have to compare with real life Python scripts which can't be as much optimized by Pypy as this crafted example. So in real life you get a C code that may be slowed down a bit by dynamic linking, and python scripts that are much slower because Pypy isn't ready to match C speed for everything (yet).<br><br>If you want to use a crafted Python example, you have to compare it to a crafted C example, so that you can compare apples with apples.<br><br>All that is methodology, that said JIT is quite powerful and it's impressive in itself to beat CPython by a large margin.<br></p></body></html>

<html><body><p>In general, if you want to compare the performance of languages, you're actually supposed to try to write the *fastest* implementation in each language.  Not just some arbitrary one.<br><br>In this example, the program has no output, so both implementations are crap and could be made a lot faster.<br><br>Come up with a program that has testable output, and see if someone can't comment with a C program that's faster than your python.</p></body></html>

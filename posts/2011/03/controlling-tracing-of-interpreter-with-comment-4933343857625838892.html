<html><body><p>Carl, thanks for the post. The information is very helpful.<br><br>While I understand special casing to overwrite the default tracing/not-tracing rules can help performance, I wonder how well are the default heuristics performing. Do you have any bulk part estimation of the performance loss by turning off special casing? And how many hints (related to whether to trace or unroll) do you have to introduce to PyPy?</p></body></html>

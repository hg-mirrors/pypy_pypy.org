<html><body><p>@cfbolz I think one reason why maps+version tags are fast is because we lack jit.unroll_safe on several lookup functions when version tags are disabled. Marking them as unrollable would speed things up.<br><br>The reasoning behind this is that old style classes which have maps, but no version tags are much faster than new style classes with version tags disabled.</p></body></html>

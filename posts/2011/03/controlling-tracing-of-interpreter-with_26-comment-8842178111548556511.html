<html><body><p>Thanks for taking the time to answer my query. <br><br>The use of class versions eliminates the opaque function being called because the JIT knows the return will be constant. This allows optimizations to work correctly. But this makes me wonder how much of the improvement is due to class versions and how much is due to lack of opaqueness. <br><br>At any rate, I always find the posts on this blog very interesting. It definitely some neat stuff you are doing here.</p></body></html>

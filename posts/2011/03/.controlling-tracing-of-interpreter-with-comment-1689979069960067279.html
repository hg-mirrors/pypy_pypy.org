<html><body><p>@GaÃ«tan: those are excellent questions!<br><br>Yes, functions in the interpreter with loops that we do not trace are not optimized at all. For most of these functions this is not a problem, e.g. string concatenation does not have much optimization potential anyway. However, there are some functions with loops (like the implementation of the map builtin) that would benefit from tracing, and we don't have a good general solution for that yet.<br><br>One of the ideas for solutions are indeed to try to start new traces in the interpreter functions with loops. We did not get around to playing with this yet, as there are not so many cases in the Python interpreter where this leads to a huge benefit.</p></body></html>

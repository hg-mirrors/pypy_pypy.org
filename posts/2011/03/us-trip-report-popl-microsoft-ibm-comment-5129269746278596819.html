<html><body><p>Hi Fijall,<br><br>I'm afraid I don't know about benchmarks and comparison between these languages, other than the shootout. I guess this is the first reference someone gets when comparing languages, since it's the most popular out there.<br><br>But it would be great if there was a resource to compare against other languages. At least, from a marketing point of view, it would be very good for pypy.<br><br>May I know why the shootout is not a good parameter?<br><br>And, is there any other benchmarks comparing pypy against v8, tracemonkey/j√§germonkey, etc..?</p></body></html>

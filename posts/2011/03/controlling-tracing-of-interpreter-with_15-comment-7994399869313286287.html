<html><body><p>Again a very interesting post. I would like some precisions for one sentence:<br>"If x takes on even more values, a new trace will eventually be made for all of them, linking them into a chain."<br><br>Does it mean they are all tried in sequence, or is there some dispatch mechanism? If there isn't, wouldn't it be beneficial to have one in place (probably using a hash table of some sort) when there is more than a few values? Or is the number of "generated branches" never supposed to be large enough to make such an approach worthwile?</p></body></html>

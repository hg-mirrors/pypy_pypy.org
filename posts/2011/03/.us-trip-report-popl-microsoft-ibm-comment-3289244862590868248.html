<html><body><p>Hi Ivan.<br><br>Shootout is not good because it contains heavily tuned programs, some of them even massively stretching the benchmark restrictions. They're tailored towards specific implementations, contain specific per-benchmark options etc. Nobody looked at python programs at detail and especially from PyPy perspective. This would need to be done first to compare those fairly, until it's not done, it's comparing naive version to a heavily optimized one and not comparing languages.<br><br>From what I measured roughly PyPy comes on par with tracemonkey and about 2x slower V8. But those were very unscientific experiments and I'll deny everything :)<br><br>I don't think there is any good cross-language comparison and that's at least partly due to the fact that workloads differ in different languages. Most shootout programs for example are tailored towards C workloads. Optimizing precisely for them (even if you have a good programs) is kind of fun, but it does not represent what we try to achieve, that is speeding up large python programs.<br><br>I hope this answers your question.<br><br>Cheers,<br>fijal</p></body></html>

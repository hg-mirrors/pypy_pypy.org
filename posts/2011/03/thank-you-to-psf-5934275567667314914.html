<html><body><p>This year's PyCon was an incredible time; several members of the PyPy team were
there, and we'll be blogging more about our experiences in the coming days.
However, we quickly wanted to extend a thank you to the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/psf/">Python Software
Foundation (PSF)</a>.</p>
<p>As you may have heard, on Friday morning at PyCon Jesse Noller handed the PyPy
team a check for $10,000, on behalf of the PSF.  This was in recognition of our
success over the past few years in bringing PyPy from a research project
to a fast, compliant, production-ready Python implementation, and to allow us
to continue our work on making it faster and more up-to-date with upstream
version changes.</p>
<p>Beyond the large check, we're grateful for the endorsement this represents,
not only of our work on PyPy, but also of all alternatve Python VMs.
The PSF has shifted its focus from representing just CPython to representing
the Python Language, reguardless of its implementation, something we are very
appreciative of.</p>

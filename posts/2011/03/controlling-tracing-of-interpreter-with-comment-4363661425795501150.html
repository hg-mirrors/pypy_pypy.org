<html><body><p>Thanks for the very interesting post!<br><br>Sorry if the following questions are naive, but you post makes me wonder if not tracing at all the functions which contain loops with a varying number of iteration means that no optimization is possible at all for those loops? Also, wouldn't it be possible to detect there is a loop and produce a special kind of trace in that case which do not duplicate the body of the loop? I guess that if it was possible and useful, you'd have done it, so I guess the real question is: why doesn't this work?</p></body></html>

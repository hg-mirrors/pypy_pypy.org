<html><body><p>No, I wasn't confusing the two levels involved (if pypy wasn't optimizing variable-length loops in userlevel code, it wouldn't optimize much I guess). <br><br>My point was more theoretical: I guess that, in theory, those loops would benefit from optimizations like any other part of the interpreter. Your answer leads me to believe that *in practice* this isn't an issue because there are either not that many of them in the interpreter and/or they are not in speed critical parts and most of those that are important speed-wise have been taken care of manually in some way or another.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>I'm puzzled now. I fail to see why those loops "do not have much optimization potential". I can understand that it's hard to optimize them because of the trace problem but I thought they would benefit from optimization like any other code (eg avoiding boxing/unboxing temporary variables), especially since they are within a loop, hence any gain will be multiplied by the number of iterations.</p></body></html>

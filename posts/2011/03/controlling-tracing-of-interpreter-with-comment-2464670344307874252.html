<html><body><p>@GaÃ«tan:<br>is it possible that you are mixing up the two levels involved? The post talked only about functions in the interpreter, not about the functions in pure Python that a user of the interpreter might write. To clarify:<br><br>- All loops on the application level, i.e. in the program the user wrote, are traceable and will be traced if they are executed often enough.<br><br>- Some loops in the interpreter itself are not. Most of these loops do not do any boxing/unboxing, so they won't benefit from optimization. For some of the loops that would benefit we added some manual hacks to trace them anyway, e.g. for the implementation of "map". Some others still need to be improved, e.g. any, all, zip, ...</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>Hi Peng,<br><br>Thanks :-). No, I didn't really do benchmarks yet, plan to do so in the future (these blog posts will turn into a paper soonish).<br><br>There are about 20-30 unroll_safe hints and equally many dont_look_inside hints. Some of them are really important, ie the speed would be abysmal without them. Most of them are really in the bytecode dispatch area, they are cases that e.g. Jython would not have, because in Jython the Python-to-Java compiler takes care of them.</p></body></html>

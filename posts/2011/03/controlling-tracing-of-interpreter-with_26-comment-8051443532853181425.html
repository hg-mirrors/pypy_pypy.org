<html><body><p>I'd love to see a blog post about conventions to favor or avoid while writing python code to best take advantage of these excellent features.  For example, your previous post implied something like this would be faster than changing the class directly:<br><br>class Counter(object):<br>....def __init__(self):<br>........self.count = 0<br>....def increment(self):<br>........self.count += 1<br><br>class Many(object):<br>....counter = Counter()<br>....def __init__(self):<br>........self.counter.increment()<br><br>Granted, it would be preferable, from a coding standpoint, to just use a simple class attribute, but the adaptations that would likely work best for the pypy JIT seem like far smaller divergences from the 'ideal' python than many other lengths people go to when coding for speed, particularly compared to something like cython.</p></body></html>

Unfortunately this introduces a dependency on the library (for instance libssl mentioned in the comment thread) and it usually increases the complexity of your code.<br><br>Using PyPy you can solve computationally intensive problems in plain Python. Writing in Python saves development time. This is what the comparison is all about.</p></body></html>

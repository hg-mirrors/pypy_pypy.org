<html><body><p>@illume:<br>This example shows pure python code and compares its execution time in cpython and pypy. Nothing else. Writing graphics code in pure python that runs not dreadfully slow was to my knowledge never before shown.<br>If enough people understand the potential of this technique and put their time into it, we will hopefully come closer to  your (5 * 5 * 8) acceleration in pypy, too.<br>I will for sure work on this.</p></body></html>

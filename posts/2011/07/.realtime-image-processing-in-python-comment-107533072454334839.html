Unfortunately pypy can't be misled with the symlink hack: "Reason: Incompatible library version: pypy requires version 0.9.8 or later, but libssl.0.9.8.dylib provides version 0.9.7"<br><br>It seem like the prebuilt was created on a 10.6, and it does not work on vanilla 10.5 systems. Not a big deal, but is good to know.</p></body></html>

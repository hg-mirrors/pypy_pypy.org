<html><body><p>@Anonymous: most probably, the prebuilt PyPy for Mac Os X was built on a system different (older?) than yours.<br><br>For a quick workaround, you can try to do "ln -s /usr/lib/libssl-XXX.dylib /usr/lib/libssl.0.9.8.dylib".  This should at least make it working, but of course it might break in case you actually use libssl.<br><br>The proper fix is to recompile PyPy by yourself.</p></body></html>

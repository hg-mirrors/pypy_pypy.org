<html><body><p>@schmichael<br><br>to avoid the potential problem of infinite tracing, the JIT bails out if it traces "too much", depending on the trace_limit.<br>In this case, the default trace_limit is not enough to fully optimize the whole algorithm, hence we need to help the JIT by telling it to trace a bit more than usual.<br><br>I agree that having to mess up with the internal parameters of the JIT is suboptimal.  I plan to address this issue in the next weeks.</p></body></html>

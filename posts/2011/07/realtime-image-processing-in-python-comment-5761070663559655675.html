<html><body><p>Hello,<br><br>it's lovely that pypy can do this.  This result is amazing, wonderful, and is very kittens.  pypy is fast at running python code (*happy dance*).<br><br>But.<br><br>It also makes kittens cry when you compare to CPython in such a way.<br><br>The reality is that CPython users would do this using a library like numpy, opencv, pygame, scipy, pyopengl, freej (the list of real time video processing python libraries is very large, so I won't list them all here).<br><br>Of course python can do this task well, and has for more than 10 years.<br><br>This code does not take advantage of vectorization through efficient SIMD, multiple cores or graphics hardware, and isn't careful with reusing memory - so is not within an order of magnitude of the speed of CPython code with libraries doing real time video processing.  <br><br>Anyone within the field would ask about using these features.<br><br>Another question they would ask is about pauses. How does the JIT affect pauses in animation? What are the rules for when the JIT warms up, and how can you tell when the code will start running fast? How does the GC affect pauses?  If there is a way to turn off the GC, or reuse memory in some way such that the GC won't cause the program to fail(Remember that in realtime a pause is a program fail).  Does the GC pool memory of similar size objects automatically?  Does the GC work well with 256MB-1GB-16GB sized objects?  In a 16GB system, can you use 15GB of objects, and then delete those objects to then use another 15GB of different objects?  Or will the program swap, or fragment memory causing pauses?<br><br>Please don't make kittens cry.  Be realistic with CPython comparisons.<br><br><br>At the moment the python implementation is not as elegant as a vector style implementation.  A numpy/matlab/CUDA/OpenCL approach looks really nice for this type of code.  One speed up might be to reuse memory, or act in place where possible.  For example, not copying the image... unless the GC magically takes care of that for you.</p></body></html>

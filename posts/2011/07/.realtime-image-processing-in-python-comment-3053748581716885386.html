<html><body><p>I think you are still missing the point of the post.  It was not "use pure Python to write your video processing algos".  That's of course nonsense, given the amount and quality of existing C extension modules to do that.<br><br>The point is that when you want to experiment with writing a new algorithm of any kind, it is now possible to do it in pure Python instead of, say, C code.  If later your project needs to move past the experimentation phase, you will have to decide if you want to keep that Python code, rewrite it in C, or (if applicable) use SIMD instructions from Python or from C, or whatever.<br><br>The real point of this demo is to show that PyPy makes Python fast enough as an early experimentation platform for almost any kind of algorithm.  If you can write in Python instead of in C, you'll save 50% of your time (random estimate); and then for the 5% of projects that go past the experimentation phase and where Python is not enough (other random estimate), spend more time learning other techniques and using them.  The result is still in your favor, and it's only going to be more so as PyPy continues to improve.</p></body></html>

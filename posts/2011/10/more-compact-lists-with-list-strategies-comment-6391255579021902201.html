<html><body><p>Winston: Indeed, very clever of you to notice :)  However, we noticed as well, going forward integers (and other primitives) identity will be a function of their value, not the identity of their box.  This means that for all ints `i is x` if and only if `i == x`.  This also means that `id()` is now a function of value for primitives.  Don't rely on that though!  Just like we don't want people relying on `i is x` if `i == x and -100 &lt; i &lt; 200`, we don't want people relying on this either.<br><br>Anonymous:<br><br>Yes, this is definitely a consideration, I keep meaning to make time to work on this.</p></body></html>

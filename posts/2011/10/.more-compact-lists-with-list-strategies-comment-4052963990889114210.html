<html><body><p>I can see float support presenting some interesting challenges being emblematic of a wider issue.  It would be very easy for someone to have a list of "floats" but if they populated it with any literals, most likely they'll be integer literals, missing any of the float optimization.<br><br>For most apps this won't be a problem but if someone is trying to optimize their application they might see this as a performance heisenbug.  For example they write a hard coded list and it is slow, read it from a file and it is fast.<br><br>One approach is for there to be a document on some website (that gets out of date) that lists PyPy micro-optimizations.  Someone would then need continually audit their code against that list.  This doesn't seem practical.<br><br>I've seen posted some low level visualization tools.  I'd be curious how practical it would be to have a higher level profiler tool integrate with the JIT to detect patterns like the list of mixed float/int situation to flag these micro-optimizations in a more automated fashion.</p></body></html>

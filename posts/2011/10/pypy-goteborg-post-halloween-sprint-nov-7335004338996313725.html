<html><body><p>The next PyPy sprint will be in Gothenburg, Sweden. It is a public sprint,
suitable for newcomers.  We'll focus on making a public kickoff for
both the <a class="reference external" href="http://pypy.org/numpydonate.html">numpy/pypy integration project</a>
and the <a class="reference external" href="http://pypy.org/py3donate.html">Py3k support project</a>,
as well as whatever interests the Sprint attendees.  Since both of these
projects are very new, there will be plenty of work suitable for newcomers
to PyPy.</p>
<p>Other topics might include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Helping people get their code running with PyPy</li>
<li>work on a FSCons talk?</li>
<li>state of the STM Vinnova project (We most likely, but not for certain will
know whether or not we are approved by this date.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Location</h3>
<p>The sprint will be held in the apartment of Laura Creighton and Jacob Hallén
which is at Götabergsgatan 22 in Gothenburg, Sweden.  Here is a <a class="reference external" href="http://bit.ly/grRuQe">map</a>.  This is
in central Gothenburg.  It is between the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.vasttrafik.se/en/">tram</a> stops of Vasaplatsen and
Valand, (a distance of 4 blocks) where many lines call -- the 2, 3, 4, 5,
7, 10 and 13.</p>
<p>Probably cheapest and not too far away is to book accomodation at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sgsveckobostader.se/en">SGS
Veckobostader</a>. The  <a class="reference external" href="http://www.elite.se/hotell/goteborg/park/">Elite Park Avenyn Hotel</a> is a luxury hotel just a
few blocks away. There are scores of hotels a short walk away from the
sprint location, suitable for every budget, desire for luxury, and desire
for the unusual.  You could, for instance, stay on a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.liseberg.se/en/home/Accommodation/Hotel/Hotel-Barken-Viking/">boat</a>.  Options are
too numerous to go into here. Just ask in the mailing list or on the blog.</p>
<p>Hours will be
from 10:00 until people have had enough.  It's a good idea to arrive a
day before the sprint starts and leave a day later.  In the middle of
the sprint there usually is a break day and it's usually ok to take
half-days off if you feel like it.  Of course, many of you may be interested
in sticking around for FSCons, held the weekend after the sprint.</p>

<h3>Good to Know</h3>
<p>Sweden is not part of the Euro zone. One SEK (krona in singular, kronor
in plural) is roughly 1/10th of a Euro (9.36 SEK to 1 Euro).</p>
<p>The venue is central in Gothenburg.  There is a large selection of
places to get food nearby, from edible-and-cheap to outstanding.  We
often cook meals together, so let us know if you have any food allergies,
dislikes, or special requirements.</p>
<p>Sweden uses the same kind of plugs as Germany. 230V AC.</p>

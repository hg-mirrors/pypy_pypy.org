<html><body><p>You haven't answered my question about reuse numpy code for 3 days, I guess because you don't know it overall. I'm not 100% agree with neither Travis opinion nor Stefan M comment from http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2011/09/py3k-for-pypy-fundraiser.html , but in answer to Stefan M you say "Since this is open source, people either work on what they like, because it's fun or scratches their itch" and "Improving the [C extensions] support is boring and frustrating". Guys, AFAIK you received FP7 support for developing some soft for users, not for fun. You should spend some efforts for boring yet important work toward the mentioned things, if you would like to obtain further increase of users number and finance support. Also, clarification about reusing CPython numpy code is also highly appreciated.</p></body></html>

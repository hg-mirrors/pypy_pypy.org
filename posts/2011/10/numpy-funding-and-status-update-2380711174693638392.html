<html><body><p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>It's been a little while since we wrote about NumPy on PyPy, so we wanted to
give everyone an update on what we've been up to, and what's up next for us.</p>
<p>We would also like to note that we're launching a <strong>funding campaign</strong>
for NumPy support in PyPy. Details can be found on the <a class="reference external" href="http://pypy.org/numpydonate.html">donation page</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the things that have happened since last we wrote are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We added <tt class="docutils literal">dtype</tt> support, meaning you can now create arrays of a bunch of
different types, including bools, ints of a various sizes, and floats.</li>
<li>More array methods and ufuncs, including things like comparison methods
(<tt class="docutils literal">==</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">&gt;</tt>, etc.)</li>
<li>Support for more and more argument types, for example you can index by a
tuple now (only works with tuples of length one, since we only have
single-dimension arrays thus far).</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the things we're working on at the moment:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>More dtypes, including complex values and user-defined dtypes.</li>
<li>Subscripting arrays by other array as indices, and by bool arrays as masks.</li>
<li>Starting to reuse Python code from the original numpy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the things on the near horizon are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Better support for scalar data, for example did you know that
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">numpy.array([True],</span> <span class="pre">dtype=bool)[0]</span></tt> doesn't return a <tt class="docutils literal">bool</tt> object?
Instead it returns a <tt class="docutils literal">numpy.bool_</tt>.</li>
<li>Multi-dimensional array support.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're interested in helping out, we always love more contributors,
Alex, Maciej, Justin, and the whole PyPy team</p></body></html>

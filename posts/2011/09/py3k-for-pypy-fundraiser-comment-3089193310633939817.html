<html><body><p>Two comments:<br><br>1. It would be really nice to see a semi-frequently updated progress bar (live is best) with # of dollars and # of contributions for the fundraising.<br><br>Part of the excitement created by sites like Kickstarter (and the Humble Indie Bundle and so on) is seeing how your small contribution adds to the whole.  A donate button feels more like throwing your money into a dark hole (a very reasonable and worthwhile hole, but a hole nonetheless).  Take advantage of some video game psychology and give us that "level up" feedback when we contribute!  :)<br><br>2.  I know you don't want to oversubscribe yourselves, but would you consider doing a similar funding drive for Numpy support?  PLEASE???</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>a) please, please get the pages lac showed in her lightning talk at pycon.uk online.<br>   - There are pictures of people in it, and it is easier to donate to people then to something abstract<br>   - there is text what happened<br>   - there is text that anonymous donation is possible<br><br>b) please, work on the feedback. It is CRUCIAL to show the actual state. Giving 5€ and nothing happens is dull. Giving 5€ and a number goes up - good. Giving 500€ and a rendered bar moves a pixel - awesome!<br><br>c) I found the Python3PyPy fundraiser easily. I did not find the numpypy fundraiser. Please, put lacs pages up :) if I can vote for them somewhere, please let me know.</p></body></html>

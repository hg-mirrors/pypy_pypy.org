<html><body><p>* Who needs Python 3 support??? *<br><br>It looks like the PyPy project is adding things just to improve something and keep doing something but for who's sake?<br><br>I really need is proper support for C extensions. Without it, people who use Python professionally like myself, cannot switch to PyPy and we are stuck with Cython and/or Psyco.<br><br>Who steers the development of Pypy and why would these people refuse to realize what hinders thousands of developers, who would love to use Pypy to make the switch from CPython ???<br><br>Please tell me which real software projects use PyPy and for what reason they would need Py3K support!<br><br><br>Go ahead and add more language constructs that you can use to run academic programs even faster and keep ignoring what is really necessary to push Pypy into day-to-day usability<br><br>(* frustrated *)</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>cpython3 is a fork of cpython2, but here you intend to support both versions with the same codebase. Does not this make the task much harder, and peeking into cpython3 code for guidance less useful? Also, isn't it possible that the resulting large set of switch (PYVERSION) {} statements will make the code less readable and maintainable?<br><br>Anyway, I have full faith in your assessment of the best approach, but I am still interested in your explanation. :)</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>Hi Maciej,<br><br>I realize that I came across in a somewhat obnoxious way. Sorry for that - I simply did not realize that PyPy is a true hobbyist project (at least currently).<br>I wish I could contribute funding but though I am using Python a lot at work, we are a National Lab and struggling to keep our government funding ourselves.<br><br>I hope a deep-pocket corporate will fund the Numpy development<br><br>Cheers, Stefan</p></body></html>

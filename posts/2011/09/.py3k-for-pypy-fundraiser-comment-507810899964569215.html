<html><body><p>Hi Stefan. There is noone who steers direction in PyPy. Since this is open source, people either work on what they like, because it's fun or scratches their itch. Note that Python 3 work is something that people expressed interest in funding -- if they fund it enough, why wouldn't developers work on it? It's more interesting than most jobs.<br><br>With regard to C extensions - it's good enough for many people, like quora to run on PyPy. Improving the support is boring and frustrating, so I don't think anyone would be willing to invest significant amount of his *free time* into that. However, feel free to speak with your money, you know how to find me.<br><br>Cheers,<br>fijal</p></body></html>

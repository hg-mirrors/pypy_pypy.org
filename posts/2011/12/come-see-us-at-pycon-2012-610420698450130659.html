represented there.  We'll be delivering a tutorial, two talks, plus we'll be<br>
around for the sprints.</p><p>Here are the abstracts for the tutorials and talks:</p><ul class="simple"><li><strong>How to get the most out of your PyPy</strong>, by Maciej Fijalkowski, Alex Gaynor<br>
and Armin Rigo: For many applications PyPy can provide performance benefits<br>
right out of the box. However, little details can push your application to<br>
perform much better. In this tutorial we'll give you insights on how to push<br>
PyPy to its limits. We'll focus on understanding the performance<br>
characteristics of PyPy, and learning the analysis tools in order to maximize<br>
your applications' performance. <em>This is the tutorial.</em></li>
<li><strong>Why PyPy by example</strong>, by Maciej Fijalkowski, Alex Gaynor and Armin Rigo:<br>
One of the goals of PyPy is to make existing Python code faster; however an<br>
even broader goal was to make it possible to write things in Python that<br>
previously would needed to be written in C or other low-level language. This<br>
talk will show examples of this, and describe how they represent the<br>
tremendous progress PyPy has made, and what it means for people looking at<br>
using PyPy.</li>
<li><strong>How the PyPy JIT works</strong>, by Benjamin Peterson: The Python community is<br>
abuzz about the major speed gains PyPy can offer for pure Python code. But how<br>
does the PyPy JIT actually work? This talk will discuss how the PyPy JIT is<br>
implemented. It will include descriptions of the tracing, optimization, and<br>
assembly generation phases. I will demonstrate each step with an example loop.</li>
</ul><p>If you have any questions let us know!  We look forward to seeing people at<br>
PyCon and chatting about PyPy and the entire Python ecosystem.</p><p>See you there,<br>
Maciej Fijalkowski, Alex Gaynor, Benjamin Peterson, Armin Rigo, and the entire PyPy team</p></body></html>

over <a class="reference external" href="http://morepypy.blogspot.ch/2013/05/pypy-20-einstein-sandwich.html">2.0</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://morepypy.blogspot.ch/2013/05/pypy-201-bohr-smrrebrd.html">2.0.1</a>.  You can download it here:</p>

<p>It fixes a crash in the JIT when calling external C functions (with
ctypes/cffi) in a multithreaded context.</p>

<h1>What is PyPy?</h1>
<p>PyPy is a very compliant Python interpreter, almost a drop-in replacement for
CPython 2.7. It's fast (<a class="reference external" href="http://speed.pypy.org">pypy 2.0 and cpython 2.7.3</a> performance comparison)
due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.</p>
<p>This release supports x86 machines running Linux 32/64, Mac OS X 64 or
Windows 32.  Support for ARM is progressing but not bug-free yet.</p>

<div class="section" id="highlights">
<h1>Highlights</h1>
<p>This release contains only the fix described above.  A crash (or wrong
results) used to occur if all these conditions were true:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>your program is multithreaded;</li>
<li>it runs on a single-core machine or a heavily-loaded multi-core one;</li>
<li>it uses ctypes or cffi to issue external calls to C functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>This was fixed in the branch <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/commits/7c80121abbf4">emit-call-x86</a> (see the example file
<tt class="docutils literal">bug1.py</tt>).</p>
<p>Cheers,
arigo et. al. for the PyPy team</p>

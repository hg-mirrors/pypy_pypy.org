<p>Hello.</p>
<p>We're pleased to announce an alpha release of PyPy 2.0 for ARM. This is mostly
a technology preview, as we know the JIT is not yet stable enough for the
full release. However please try your stuff on ARM and report back.</p>
<p>This is the first release that supports a range of ARM devices - anything with
ARMv6 (like the Raspberry Pi) or ARMv7 (like Beagleboard, Chromebook,
Cubieboard, etc.) that supports VFPv3 should work. We provide builds with
support for both ARM EABI variants: hard-float and some older operating
systems soft-float.</p>
<p>This release comes with a list of limitations, consider it alpha quality,
not suitable for production:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>stackless support is missing.</li>
<li>assembler produced is not always correct, but we successfully managed to
run large parts of our extensive benchmark suite, so most stuff should work.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can download the PyPy 2.0 alpha ARM release here (including a deb for raspbian):</p>

<p>Part of the work was sponsored by the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi foundation</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-is-pypy">
<h3>What is PyPy?</h3>
<p>PyPy is a very compliant Python interpreter, almost a drop-in replacement for
CPython 2.7.3. It's fast due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.</p>
<p>This release supports ARM machines running Linux 32bit. Both hard-float
<tt class="docutils literal">armhf</tt> and soft-float <tt class="docutils literal">armel</tt> builds are provided.  <tt class="docutils literal">armhf</tt> builds are
created using the Raspberry Pi custom <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/raspberrypi">cross-compilation toolchain</a> based on
gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf and should work on ARMv6 and ARMv7 devices running at
least debian or ubuntu. <tt class="docutils literal">armel</tt> builds are built using gcc-arm-linux-gnuebi
toolchain provided by ubuntu and currently target ARMv7.  If there is interest
in other builds, such as gnueabi for ARMv6 or without requiring a VFP let us
know in the comments or in IRC.</p>

<div class="section" id="benchmarks">
<h3>Benchmarks</h3>
<p>Everybody loves benchmarks. Here is a table of our benchmark suite
(for ARM we don't provide it yet on <a class="reference external" href="http://speed.pypy.org">http://speed.pypy.org</a>,
unfortunately).</p>
<p>This is a comparison of Cortex A9 processor with 4M cache and Xeon W3580 with
8M of L3 cache. The set of benchmarks is a subset of what we run for
<a class="reference external" href="http://speed.pypy.org">http://speed.pypy.org</a> that finishes in reasonable time. The ARM machine
was provided by Calxeda.
Columns are respectively:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>benchmark name</li>
<li>PyPy speedup over CPython on ARM (Cortex A9)</li>
<li>PyPy speedup over CPython on x86 (Xeon)</li>
<li>speedup on Xeon vs Cortex A9, as measured on CPython</li>
<li>speedup on Xeon vs Cortex A9, as measured on PyPy</li>
<li>relative speedup (how much bigger the x86 speedup is over ARM speedup)</li>
</ul>

<p>It seems that Cortex A9, while significantly slower than Xeon, has higher
slowdowns with a large interpreter (CPython) than a JIT compiler (PyPy). This
comes as a surprise to me, especially that our ARM assembler is not nearly
as polished as our x86 assembler. As for the causes, various people mentioned
branch predictor, but I would not like to speculate without actually knowing.</p>

<h3>How to use PyPy?</h3>
<p>We suggest using PyPy from a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/">virtualenv</a>. Once you have a virtualenv
installed, you can follow instructions from <a class="reference external" href="http://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/getting-started.html#installing-using-virtualenv">pypy documentation</a> on how
to proceed. This document also covers other <a class="reference external" href="http://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/getting-started.html#installing-pypy">installation schemes</a>.</p>
<p>We would not recommend using in production PyPy on ARM just quite yet,
however the day of a stable PyPy ARM release is not far off.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
fijal, bivab, arigo and the whole PyPy team</p>

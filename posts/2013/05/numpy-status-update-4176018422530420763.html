<html><body><p>Hello Everyone,<br>
<br>
I've started to work on NumPyPy since the end of April and here is a short update :<br>
<br>
</p><ul>
<li>I implemented pickling support on ndarrays and dtypes, it will be compatible with numpy's pickling protocol when the "numpypy" module will be renamed to "numpy".</li>
<li>I am now working on subarrays.</li>
</ul>

<br></div>
<div>
I would also like to thank everyone who donated and allowed me to work on this.</div>
<div>
<br></div>
<div>
Cheers,</div>

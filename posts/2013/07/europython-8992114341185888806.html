<html><body><p>Hi all,</p>

<p>A short note: if you're at EuroPython right now and wondering if PyPy is
dead because you don't see the obviously expected talk about PyPy, don't
worry.  PyPy is still alive and kicking.  The truth is two-fold: (1) we
missed the talk deadline (duh!)... but as importantly, (2) for various
reasons we chose not to travel to Florence this year after our trip to
PyCon US.  (Antonio Cuni is at Florence but doesn't have a talk about PyPy
either.)</p>

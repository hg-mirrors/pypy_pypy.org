<html><body><p>The next PyPy sprint will be in London, United Kingdom for the first
time. This is a fully public sprint. PyPy sprints are a very good way
to get into PyPy development and no prior PyPy knowledge is necessary.</p>
<h2>Goals and topics of the sprint</h2>
<p>For newcomers:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>bring your application/library and we'll help you port it to PyPy,
benchmark and profile</li>
<li>come and write your favorite missing numpy function</li>
<li>help us work on developer tools like jitviewer</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll also work on:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>refactoring the JIT optimizations</li>
<li>STM and STM-related topics</li>
<li>anything else attendees are interested in</li>
</ul>
<h2>Exact times</h2>
<p>The work days should be August 26 - September 1 2013 (Monday-Sunday).
The official plans are for people to arrive on the 26th, and
to leave on the 2nd. There will be a break day in the middle.
We'll typically start at 10:00 in the morning.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The sprint will happen within a room of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/">King's College's</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/campuslife/campuses/strand/StrandCampusLocation.aspx">Strand

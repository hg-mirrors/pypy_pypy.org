<p>PyPy is a fast Python VM. Maybe you've never used PyPy and want to find out
what use it might be for you? Or you and your organisation have been using it
and you want to find out more about how it works under the hood? If so, this
demo session is for you!</p>
<p>Members of the PyPy team will give a series of lightning talks on PyPy: its
benefits; how it works; research currently being undertaken to make it
faster; and unusual uses it can be put to. Speakers will be available
afterwards for informal discussions. This is the first time an event like
this has been held in the UK, and is a unique opportunity to speak to core
people. Speakers confirmed thus far include: Armin Rigo, <a class="reference external" href="http://baroquesoftware.com/">Maciej Fija≈Çkowski</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://cfbolz.de">Carl Friedrich Bolz</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://lukasdiekmann.com/">Lukas Diekmann</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://tratt.net/laurie/">Laurence Tratt</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://eddbarrett.co.uk/">Edd Barrett</a>.</p>
<p>The venue for this talk is the <a class="reference external" href="http://soft-dev.org/">Software Development Team</a>, King's College
London. The main entrance is on the Strand, from where the room for the event
will be clearly signposted. Travel directions can be found at

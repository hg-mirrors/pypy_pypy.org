<html><body><p>I've been looking at cffi since it was first mentioned on our Pygame mailing list. It does look promising. I see only two, buffer related, issues that need to be resolved.<br><br>First, PyPy lacks an array export mechanism comparable to the <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3118/" rel="nofollow">CPython PEP 3113 buffer protocol</a>. Instead, only the <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/arrays.interface.html" rel="nofollow">NumPy Array Interface, version: 3</a> is available. Though Pygame supports both the Python and C sides of the interface, it relies on CPython's reference counting for timely buffer release [1]. Periodic garbage collection is too unpredictable.<br><br>Second, the cffi module does not support CPython api function calls. So a cffi Pygame could not support the buffer protocol on CPython.<br><br>A possible solution to the first issue is for PyPy to use an extended array interface that includes a PEP 3118 like buffer release callback. I am working to resolve the second issue: <a href="http://bugs.python.org/issue13797" rel="nofollow">[Issue13797] Allow objects implemented in pure Python to export PEP 3118 buffers</a>.<br><br>[1] <a href="https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame/issue/173/add-pep-3118-new-buffer-support-to-pygame" rel="nofollow">Add PEP 3118 (new) buffer support to Pygame surfaces</a></p></body></html>

<html><body><p>Ah, ok.  Very nice work anyway.  It's impressive what you all managed to get done in the sprint :)<br><br>Here's some information from pygame land about where the project is heading.<br><br>SDL 1 is the past, and the SDL developers are no longer putting out releases.  However, I think many people will continue to patch it up for many years. SDL 2 is the future and after many years finally has a release out (2 now).  pysdl2 is part of the future of pygame.  pysdl2 matches the SDL 2 API as closely as possible.  A pygame API ontop of pysdl2 is the future of pygame.<br><br>ctypes is no good for some platforms like iOS, and the web and pypy apparently.  Although note, that pysdl2 already 'works' on top of pypy.<br><br>https://bitbucket.org/marcusva/py-sdl2/<br>http://pysdl2.readthedocs.org/en/latest/<br><br><br>Happy hacking :)</p></body></html>

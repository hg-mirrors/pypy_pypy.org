<html><body><p>@Armin Rigo: Yeah, it's no use pushing GC pauses much lower than other pauses, but that just means other things need improving as well. ;) If I had to draw an arbitrary line, I'd say half a frame (i.e. 8ms for 60fps, 4ms for 120fps 3D) is probably a good target for the maximum.<br><br>The thing with CPython is that you can turn the GC off and still have everything non-cyclic collected. So with enough attention to detail you can avoid GC pauses completely.<br><br>BTW, is any work ongoing with regard to fully concurrent GC?</p></body></html>

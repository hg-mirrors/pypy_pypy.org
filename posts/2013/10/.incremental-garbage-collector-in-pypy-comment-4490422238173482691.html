<html><body><p>@Anonymous: our incminimark comes with no serious strong guarantee.  I still think it's enough for most games, say, if "almost all" the pauses are around 10ms.  It's also tweakable (see the PYPY_GC_* environment variables documented in rpython/memory/gc/incminimark.py, and try to call something like gc.collect(1) at the end of each frame).<br><br>Anyway, at around the same time scale is the time spent JITting, which also causes apparent pauses in the program.  I think that fixing it all with really strong guarantees is a much, much harder problem.  CPython doesn't gives any guarantee either, as explained at the start of the blog post.</p></body></html>

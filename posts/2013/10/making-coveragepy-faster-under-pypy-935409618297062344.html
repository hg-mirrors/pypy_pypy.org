<html><body><p>If you've ever tried to run your programs with <tt class="docutils literal">coverage.py</tt> under PyPy,<br>
you've probably experienced some incredible slowness. Take this simple<br>
program:</p><pre class="code python literal-block"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="name function">f</span><span class="punctuation">():</span>
    <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="literal number integer">1</span>


<span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="name function">main</span><span class="punctuation">():</span>
    <span class="name">i</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="literal number integer">10000000</span>
    <span class="keyword">while</span> <span class="name">i</span><span class="punctuation">:</span>
        <span class="name">i</span> <span class="operator">-=</span> <span class="name">f</span><span class="punctuation">()</span>

<span class="name">main</span><span class="punctuation">()</span>
</pre><p>Running <tt class="docutils literal">time coverage.py run test.py</tt> five times, and looking at the best<br>
run, here's how PyPy 2.1 stacks up against CPython 2.7.5:</p><table border="1" class="docutils"><colgroup>
<col width="32%">
<col width="19%">
<col width="49%">
</colgroup>
<thead valign="bottom">
<tr><th class="head">Python</th>
<th class="head">Time</th>
<th class="head">Normalized to CPython</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td>CPython 2.7.5</td>
<td>3.879s</td>
<td>1.0x</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>PyPy 2.1</td>
<td>53.330s</td>
<td>13.7x slower</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table><p>Totally ridiculous. I got turned onto this problem because on one of my<br>
projects CPython takes about 1.5 minutes to run our test suite on the build<br>
bot, but PyPy takes 8-10 minutes.</p><p>So I sat down to address it. And the results:</p><table border="1" class="docutils"><colgroup>
<col width="32%">
<col width="19%">
<col width="49%">
</colgroup>
<thead valign="bottom">
<tr><th class="head">Python</th>
<th class="head">Time</th>
<th class="head">Normalized to CPython</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td>CPython 2.7.5</td>
<td>3.879s</td>
<td>1.0x</td>

<tr><td>PyPy 2.1</td>

<tr><td>PyPy head</td>
<td>1.433s</td>
<td>2.7x faster</td>
</tr>

</table><p>Not bad.</p><div class="section" id="technical-details"><h1>Technical details</h1><p>So how'd we do it? Previously, using <tt class="docutils literal">sys.settrace()</tt> (which <tt class="docutils literal">coverage.py</tt><br>
uses under the hood) disabled the JIT. Except it didn't just disable the JIT,<br>
it did it in a particularly insidious way â€” the JIT had no idea it was being<br>
disabled!</p><p>Instead, every time PyPy discovered that one of your functions was a hotspot,<br>
it would start tracing to observe what the program was doing, and right when it<br>
was about to finish, <tt class="docutils literal">coverage</tt> would run and cause the JIT to abort. Tracing<br>
is a slow process, it makes up for it by generating fast machine code at the<br>
end, but tracing is still incredibly slow. But we never actually got to the<br>
"generate fast machine code" stage. Instead we'd pay all the cost of tracing,<br>
but then we'd abort, and reap none of the benefits.</p><p>To fix this, we adjusted some of the heuristics in the JIT, to better show it<br>
how <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sys.settrace(&lt;tracefunc&gt;)</span></tt> works. Previously the JIT saw it as an opaque<br>
function which gets the frame object, and couldn't tell whether or not it<br>
messed with the frame object. Now we let the JIT look inside the<br>
<tt class="docutils literal">&lt;tracefunc&gt;</tt> function, so it's able to see that <tt class="docutils literal">coverage.py</tt> isn't<br>
messing with the frame in any weird ways, it's just reading the line number and<br>
file path out of it.</p><p>I asked several friends in the VM implementation and research field if they<br>
were aware of any other research into making VMs stay fast when debugging tools<br>
like <tt class="docutils literal">coverage.py</tt> are running. No one I spoke to was aware of any (but I<br>
didn't do a particularly exhaustive review of the literature, I just tweeted at<br>
a few people), so I'm pleased to say that PyPy is quite possibly the first VM<br>
to work on optimizing code in debugging mode! This is possible because of our<br>
years spent investing in meta-tracing research.</p></div><p>Happy testing,<br>

<html><body><p>Hi all,</p>

<p>For those of you that happen to be from South Africa: don't miss
<a href="http://za.pycon.org">PyCon ZA 2013</a>, next October 3rd and 4th!
Like last year, a few of us will be there.  There will be the first talk
about <a href="http://za.pycon.org/talks/15/">STM getting ready</a> (a
blog post about that should follow soon).</p>

<p>Moreover, general sprints will continue on the weekend (5th and 6th).
Afterwards, Fijal will host a longer PyPy sprint (marathon?) with me
until around the 21th.  You are welcome to it as well!  Write to the <a href="http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/pypy-dev">mailing list</a> or to fijal directly (fijall
at gmail.com), or simply in comments of <a href="http://morepypy.blogspot.ch/2013/09/pycon-south-africa-sprint.html">this post.</a></p>

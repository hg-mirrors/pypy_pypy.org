<html><body><p>Hey Armin<br><br>Thanks for the awesome presentations :-)<br><br>I'm very excited to try it out soon. I was wondering, would it not be useful to try and get the "with atomic" statement at the very least working on regular CPython? (just operating on the GIL, or simulated with a lock). This could smooth over migration somewhat?<br><br>Also, thanks for your live demo of cffi, It is so much simpler than ctypes :-)</p></body></html>

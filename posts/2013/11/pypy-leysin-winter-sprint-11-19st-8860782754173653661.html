<html><body><p>The next PyPy sprint will be in Leysin, Switzerland, for the ninth time.
This is a fully public sprint: newcomers and topics other than those
proposed below are welcome.</p>
<h3>Goals and topics of the sprint</h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Py3k: work towards supporting Python 3 in PyPy</li>
<li>NumPyPy: work towards supporting the numpy module in PyPy</li>
<li>STM: work towards supporting Software Transactional Memory</li>
<li>And as usual, the main side goal is to have fun in winter sports :-)
We can take a day off for ski.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Exact times</h3>
<p>For a change, and as an attempt to simplify things, I specified the
dates as 11-19 January 2014, where 11 and 19 are travel days.  We will
work full days between the 12 and the 18.  You are of course allowed to
show up for a part of that time only, too.</p>
<h3>Location &amp; Accomodation</h3>
<p>Leysin, Switzerland, "same place as before".  Let me refresh your
memory: both the sprint venue and the lodging will be in a very spacious
pair of chalets built specifically for bed &amp; breakfast:
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.ermina.ch/">http://www.ermina.ch/</a>.  The place has a good ADSL Internet connexion
with wireless installed.  You can of course arrange your own lodging
anywhere (as long as you are in Leysin, you cannot be more than a 15
minutes walk away from the sprint venue), but I definitely recommend
lodging there too -- you won't find a better view anywhere else (though
you probably won't get much worse ones easily, either :-)</p>
<p>Please <em>confirm</em> that you are coming so that we can adjust the
reservations as appropriate.  The rate so far has been around 60 CHF a
night all included in 2-person rooms, with breakfast.  There are larger
rooms too (less expensive per person) and maybe the possibility to get a
single room if you really want to.</p>

<p>You need a Swiss-to-(insert country here) power adapter.  There will be
some Swiss-to-EU adapters around -- bring a EU-format power strip if you
have one.</p></body></html>

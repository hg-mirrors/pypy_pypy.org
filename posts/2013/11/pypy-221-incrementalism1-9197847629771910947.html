<html><body><p>We're pleased to announce PyPy 2.2.1, which targets version 2.7.3 of the Python
language. This is a bugfix release over 2.2.</p>
<p>You can download the PyPy 2.2.1 release here:</p>

<h3>What is PyPy?</h3>
<p>PyPy is a very compliant Python interpreter, almost a drop-in replacement for
CPython 2.7. It's fast (<a class="reference external" href="http://speed.pypy.org">pypy 2.2 and cpython 2.7.2</a> performance comparison)
due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.</p>
<p>This release supports x86 machines running Linux 32/64, Mac OS X 64, Windows
32, or ARM (ARMv6 or ARMv7, with VFPv3).</p>
<p>Work on the native Windows 64 is still stalling, we would welcome a volunteer
to handle that.</p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>This is a bugfix release.  The most important bugs fixed are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>an issue in sockets' reference counting emulation, showing up
notably when using the ssl module and calling <tt class="docutils literal">makefile()</tt>.</li>
<li>Tkinter support on Windows.</li>
<li>If sys.maxunicode==65535 (on Windows and maybe OS/X), the json
decoder incorrectly decoded surrogate pairs.</li>
<li>some FreeBSD fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that CFFI 0.8.1 was released.  Both versions 0.8 and 0.8.1 are
compatible with both PyPy 2.2 and 2.2.1.</p>
<p>Cheers,
Armin Rigo &amp; everybody</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>We should note that the re-optimization is different than CPython's.  In the latter they use a "long" implementation which they heavily optimized for the common case of small integers.  In PyPy instead we use two really different implementations (like "int" and "long" on Python 2); they just happen to be exposed at the user level with the same Python type in Python 3.</p></body></html>

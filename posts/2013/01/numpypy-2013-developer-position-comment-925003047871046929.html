<html><body><p>It's been said before but as a long time NumPy and SciPy user, please please please don't call this project NumPy. It's great for PyPy to have an nd-array lib and for sure NumPy has some of the best semantics and user API for that so by all means make it compatible, but giving it the same name just makes tremendous confusion for users. For scientific users without the C-API which allows most of the widely used scientific extensions it is simply not "numpy".</p></body></html>

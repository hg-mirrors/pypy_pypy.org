<html><body><p>@Anonymous: I'd like to point out again that all this NumPy work would get more traction and faster development within PyPy if we could manage to interest (and get contributions from) anyone that comes from the scientific community.  Ourselves, we are  looking at this topic as a smallish part of the whole Python world, so we disagree (to a point) with your comment "a huge breakthrough for pypy". :-)</p></body></html>

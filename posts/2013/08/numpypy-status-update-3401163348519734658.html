<br>
As expected, nditer is a lot of work. I'm going to pause my work on it for now and focus on simpler and more important things, here is a list of what I implemented :<br>
</p><ul>
<li>Fixed a bug on 32 bit that made int32(123).dtype == dtype("int32") fail</li>
<li>Fixed a bug on the pickling of array slices</li>
<li>The external loop flag is implemented on the nditer class</li>
<li>The c_index, f_index and multi_index flags are also implemented</li>
<li>Add dtype("double") and dtype("str")</li>
<li>C-style iteration is available for nditer</li>
</ul>
Cheers<br>

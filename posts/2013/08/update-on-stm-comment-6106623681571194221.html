<html><body><p>@Armin: Ah, I see. Well, from a user's perspective, what I most write in python these days is either GUI applications (for which I've never been able to use pypy due to lack of bindings, but that's another issue entirely), or for small services, for which pypy has provided a rather nice speed improvement.<br><br>In a perfect world, I'd be able to use pypy for both of these tasks, not using STM for my GUI applications, but turning it on for the services I write (well, once they reach a certain point where I'd gain something from concurrency).<br><br>I suspect having a separate build would make such a use-case awkward.<br><br>Also, my interest is a bit self-motivated; at work we current use node.js for a lot of our services. Pypy compares decently for a lot of our tasks, but it not 'clearly better'. Once STM is stable, however, several of our services that we've struggled scaling to multiple cores on node.js could be rewritten in pypy STM, and should scale much easier. (Manual process management is painful!)<br><br>Again, if pypy STM were a seperate build, we'd have to manage having both installed in the case where we have servers running services that need concurrency, or ones that work well enough with a very fast async implementation. Not impossible, just a bit awkward. :)<br><br>Either way, I'm pretty excited!</p></body></html>

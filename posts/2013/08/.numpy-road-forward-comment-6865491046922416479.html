<html><body><p>Hi Dan.<br><br>Yes, pypy will do the removal of temporary matrices, this is a very basic optimization that we had, but disabled for a while to simplify development.<br><br>I don't think numba, numexpr or theano would ever work on PyPy (I would ask their authors though), but I personally think we can match their performance or even exceed it, time will tell though.<br><br>Cheers,<br>fijal<br></p></body></html>

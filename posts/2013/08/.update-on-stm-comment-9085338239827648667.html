<html><body><p>Thanks for the update; glad it's coming together! I'm really looking forward to seeing how it stacks up once the JIT work is complete.<br><br>Do you think that it'll be possible to ever get better than a 2x slowdown for serial operations? Or is that the minimal possible? Naively, it makes sense that it'll never be as fast, but if 1.5x or lower were possible, that would be very exciting.<br><br>Also, is the end goal that you would have a module you import to "turn on" STM? Or would it always be a separate build of pypy, just like JIT/JIT-less?</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>@Christopher: the slow-down we'll get is still unknown, but I fear it won't really go well under 2x.<br><br>I see it mainly as a separate build: either you want to run all these barrier instructions everywhere (which gives the slow-down) or not.  It could be possible in theory to have a version that has the barriers everywhere, but creates JIT-generated assembler that doesn't, and thus runs almost as fast as a regular PyPy as long as you don't "turn on" STM.  We will see if that makes sense.</p></body></html>

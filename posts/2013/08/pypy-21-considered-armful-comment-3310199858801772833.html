<html><body><p>cdecimal is purely a speed gain.  On PyPy the pure Python decimal.py is accelerated by the JIT, though it is probably possible to gain some small extra factor by rewriting it directly in RPython.<br><br>If your problem is merely that project X has listed cdecimal in its dependencies, then we could add a "cdecimal.egg-info" file that says "yup, it's installed" and be done (assuming that the API is really the same one as decimal.py).</p></body></html>

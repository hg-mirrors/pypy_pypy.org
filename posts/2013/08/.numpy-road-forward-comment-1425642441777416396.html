<html><body><p>Thanks for the info! I can't wait to play with it. <br>I only have a very rudimentary understanding of numpypy and pypy, so please forgive if this is a stupid question:<br><br>Will there be a way to do additional high level optimization steps before the JIT level? <br><br>I.e. elimination of temporaries for matrices, expression optimization and so on?<br><br>Basically check if the expression should be handled by the pypy JIT, or if if should be passed on to something like numexpr<br>http://code.google.com/p/numexpr/<br>that will itself hand over the code to optimized vendor libraries?<br><br>I am a bit concerned that while the pypy JIT optimizations are without question very impressive and probably close to optimal to what can be done for generic code, the performance issues with numerical code are very different.<br><br>Any JIT will (please correct me if I am wrong, this would be a significant breakthrough) never be able to even come close to what a vendor library like the MKL can do.<br><br>The comparison will be even more to the disadvantage of the JIT if one uses a library like Theano that runs the code on the GPU.<br><br>For my work, beating c for speed is not enough anymore, the challenges are how to run the computation in parallel, how to call optimized libraries without pain and how to use a GPU without re-writing the entire program and learning about a completely new system.<br><br>Will libraries like numexpr, numba and theano be able to run under pypy, and will it eventually be possible to automatically hand over numerical expressions automatically to these libraries?</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>Hello everyone,<br>
<br>
May was the first month I was paid to work on NumPyPy (thanks to all who donated!), here is what I worked on during this period :<br>
<br>
</p><ul>
<li>It is now possible to use subarrays.</li>
<li>It is now possible to pickle ndarrays (including those using subarrays), dtypes and scalars, the pickling protocol is the same as numpy's.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<br></div>
<div>
For June, I plan to work on the nditer class, it seems that there's enough work for an entire month.</div>
<br>
Cheers<br>

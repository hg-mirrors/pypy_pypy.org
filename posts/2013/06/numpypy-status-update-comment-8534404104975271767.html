<html><body><p>It is working great, thanks!<br><br>Now, is there any way to load the resulting pickle in cPython? <br><br>numpy.save and numpy.load do work between pypy and cPython, but my arrays are embedded in larger data structures.<br><br>The motivation is that I would like to run a numerical program and store some results, and then load the results and plot them with matplotlib (which does not work on pypy). <br><br>Here is the error in cPython:<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; pickle.load(open('/tmp/x', 'r+b'))<br>Traceback (most recent call last):<br>  File "", line 1, in <br>  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/pickle.py", line 1378, in load<br>    return Unpickler(file).load()<br>  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/pickle.py", line 858, in load<br>    dispatch[key](self)<br>  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/pickle.py", line 1090, in load_global<br>    klass = self.find_class(module, name)<br>  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/pickle.py", line 1124, in find_class<br>    __import__(module)<br>ImportError: No module named _numpypy.multiarray</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>This is the 11th status update about our work on the <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/commits/all/tip/branch%28%22py3k%22%29">py3k branch</a>, which we<br>
can work on thanks to all of the people who <a class="reference external" href="http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2012/01/py3k-and-numpy-first-stage-thanks-to.html">donated</a> to the <a class="reference external" href="http://pypy.org/py3donate.html">py3k proposal</a>.</p><p>Here's some highlights of the progress made since the previous update:</p><ul class="simple"><li>PyPy py3k now matches CPython 3's hash code for<br>
int/float/complex/Decimal/Fraction</li>
<li>Various outstanding unicode identifier related issues were<br>
resolved. E.g. test_importlib/pep263/ucn/unicode all now fully pass. Various<br>
usage of identifiers (in particular type and module names) have been fixed to<br>
handle non-ascii names -- mostly around display of reprs and exception<br>
messages.</li>
<li>The unicodedata database has been upgraded to 6.0.0.</li>
<li>Windows support has greatly improved, though it could still use some more<br>
help (but so does the default branch to a certain degree).</li>
<li>Probably the last of the parsing related bugs/features have been taken care<br>
of.</li>
<li>Of course various other smaller miscellaneous fixes</li>
</ul><p>This leaves the branch w/ only about 5 outstanding failures of the stdlib test<br>
suite:</p><ul><li><p class="first">test_float</p><p>1 failing test about containment of floats in collections.</p></li>
<li><p class="first">test_memoryview</p><p>Various failures: requires some bytes/str changes among other things (Manuel<br>
Jacob's has some progress on this on the <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/compare/py3k-memoryview..py3k">py3k-memoryview branch</a>)</p></li>
<li><p class="first">test_multiprocessing</p><p>1 or more tests deadlock on some platforms</p></li>
<li><p class="first">test_sys and test_threading</p><p>2 failing tests for the New GIL's new API</p></li>
</ul><p>Probably the biggest feature left to tackle is the New GIL.</p><p>We're now pretty close to pushing an initial release. We had planned for one<br>
around PyCon, but having missed that we've put some more effort into the branch<br>
to provide a more fully-fledged initial release.</p><p>Thanks to the following for their contributions: Manuel Jacob, Amaury Forgeot<br>
d'Arc, Karl Ramm, Jason Chu and Christian Hudon.</p><p>cheers,<br>

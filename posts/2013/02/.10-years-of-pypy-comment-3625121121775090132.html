<html><body><p>I remember 10 years ago, when I decided to learn to program... I didn't know what language to choose, and someone suggested python. It was someone I approached through a mailing list, and he was passionate explaining why python is so special.<br><br>I remember reading about it being cool but with a "performance problem". However, there were some nerds out there talking about a minimal python, that would eventually become a fast python, so I said "cool, perhaps in a few months there will be a fast python...".<br><br>I spent ten years following silently this story, and I'm happy to say "Happy birthday Pypy!".<br><br>I've never met any of you, but I feel I know you.<br>You showed me the value of perseverance, that every failure is one step closer to success.<br><br>Congratulations and a big THANK YOU!<br>Luis Gonzalez, from Buenos Aires.</p></body></html>

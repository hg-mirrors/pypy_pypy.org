<html><body><p>The <a href="http://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/cppyy.html">cppyy module</a>
provides C++ bindings for PyPy by using the reflection information extracted
from C++ header files by means of the
<a href="http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/reflex">Reflex package</a>.
In order to support C++11, the goal is to move away from Reflex and instead use
<a href="http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/cling">cling</a>, an interactive
C++ interpreter, as the backend.
Cling is based on <a href="http://llvm.org/">llvm</a>'s
<a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">clang</a>.

The use of a real compiler under the hood has the advantage that it is now
possible to cover every conceivable corner case.
The disadvantage, however, is that every corner case actually has to be
covered.
Life is somewhat easier when calls come in from the python interpreter, as
those calls have already been vetted for syntax errors and all lookups are
well scoped.
Furthermore, the real hard work of getting sane responses from and for C++
in an interactive environment is done in cling, not in the bindings.
Nevertheless, it is proving a long road (but for that matter clang does not
support all of C++11 yet), so here's a quick status update showing that good 
progress is being made.

</p><p>The following example is on CPython, not PyPy, but moving a third
(after Reflex and
<a href="http://root.cern.ch/root/Cint.html">CINT</a>) backend into place
underneath cppyy is straightforward compared to developing the backend
in the first place.

Take this snippet of C++11 code
(<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cpp11.C</span></tt>):

</p><p></p><pre>    constexpr int data_size() { return 5; }

    auto N = data_size();

    template&lt;class L, class R&gt;
    struct MyMath {
       static auto add(L l, R r) -&gt; decltype(l+r) { return l + r; }
    };

    template class MyMath&lt;int, int&gt;;</pre>

<p>As a practical matter, most usage of new C++11 features will live in
implementations, not in declarations, and are thus never seen by the bindings.
The above example is therefore somewhat contrived, but it will serve to show
that these new declarations actually work.
The new features used here are
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">constexpr</span></tt>,
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">auto</span></tt>, and
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">decltype</span></tt>.
Here is how you could use these from CPython, using the
<a href="http://root.cern.ch/viewvc/trunk/bindings/pyroot/">PyROOT</a>
package, which has more than a passing resemblance to cppyy, as one is based
on the other:

</p><p></p><pre>    import ROOT as gbl
    gbl.gROOT.LoadMacro('cpp11.C')

    print 'N =', gbl.N
    print '1+1 =', gbl.MyMath(int, int).add(1,1)</pre>

which, when entered into a file
(<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cpp11.py</span></tt>) and executed,
prints the expected results:

<p></p><pre>    $ python cpp11.py
    N = 5
    1+1 = 2</pre>

In the example, the C++ code is compiled on-the-fly, rather than first generating
a dictionary as is needed with Reflex.
A deployment model that utilizes stored pre-compiled information is foreseen
to work with larger projects, which may have to pull in headers from many places.

<p>Work is going to continue first on C++03 on cling with CPython (about 85% of
unit tests currently pass), with a bit of work on C++11 support on the side.
Once fully in place, it can be brought into a new backend for cppyy, after 
which the remaining parts of C++11 can be fleshed out for both interpreters.

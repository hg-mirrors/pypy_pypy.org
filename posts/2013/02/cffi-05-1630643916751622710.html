<html><body><p>Hi all,</p>

<p>A short notice to tell you that <a href="http://cffi.readthedocs.org/">CFFI 0.5</a> was released.  This
contains a number of small improvements from 0.4, but seems to otherwise
be quite stable since a couple of months --- no change since January 10,
apart from the usual last-minute fixes for Python 3 and for Windows.</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>

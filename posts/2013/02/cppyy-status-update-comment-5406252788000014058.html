<html><body><p>Right now, there are no PyPy objects exposed as such, but only PyObjects through cpyext in support of the python C-API. In cppyy, cpyext is used for any interface that has a PyObject* as argument or return value. It is cpyext that takes care of marrying the ref-count API with the garbage collector.<br><br>Don't pin me down on the details, but from what I understand of cpyext, a wrapper object with the proper C layout is created, and given a life line by putting it in an internal container holding all such objects safe from the gc simply by existing. When the ref count hits zero, the life line gets removed. Object identity is preserved by finding objects in the internal container and reusing them.</p></body></html>

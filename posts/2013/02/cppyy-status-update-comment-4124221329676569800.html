<html><body><p>How would memory management work for C++ objects which own PyPy objects?  In CPython, or any similar reference counting system, a C++ class can hold only references via special smart pointers.  These smart pointers don't need to be registered in any way with the outer class, since there's no need for a garbage collector to traverse from the outer object to the inner smart pointer instances.<br><br>For decent garbage collection to work, presumably one needs to be able to enumerate the PyPy objects pointed to by a C++ object.  How would this work?</p></body></html>

We’re pleased to announce PyPy 2.3, which targets version 2.7.6 of the Python language. This release updates the stdlib from 2.7.3, jumping directly to 2.7.6.<br>
<br>
This release also contains several bugfixes and performance improvements, many generated by real users finding corner cases. <a href="http://cffi.readthedocs.org/">CFFI</a> has made it easier than ever to use existing C code with both cpython and PyPy, easing the transition for packages like <a href="https://cryptography.io/">cryptography</a>, <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/2.4.0">Pillow</a>(Python Imaging Library [Fork]), a basic port of <a href="https://github.com/CTPUG/pygame_cffi">pygame-cffi</a>, and others.<br>
<br>
PyPy can now be embedded in a hosting application, for instance inside <a href="http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/PyPy.html">uWSGI</a><br>

PyPy is a very compliant Python interpreter, almost a drop-in replacement for CPython 2.7. It's fast (<a href="http://speed.pypy.org/">pypy 2.3 and cpython 2.7.x performance comparison</a>; note that cpython's speed has not changed since 2.7.2) due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.<br>
<br>
This release supports x86 machines running Linux 32/64, Mac OS X 64, Windows, and OpenBSD, as well as newer ARM hardware (ARMv6 or ARMv7, with VFPv3) running Linux. </div>

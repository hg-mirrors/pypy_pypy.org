<a href="http://www.pypy.org/">PyPy</a> is a very compliant Python interpreter, almost a drop-in replacement for <a href="https://www.python.org/">CPython</a> 2.7. It's fast (<a href="http://speed.pypy.org/">pypy 2.3.1 and cpython 2.7.x performance comparison</a>) due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.<br>
<br>
This release supports x86 machines running Linux 32/64, Mac OS X 64,  Windows, and OpenBSD, as well as newer ARM hardware (ARMv6 or ARMv7,  with VFPv3) running Linux.Â  <br>
We would like to thank our donors for the continued support of the PyPy project.<br>

<html><body><p>@anatoly<br><br>I never claimed my project is a replacement for PyOpenGL - it's not API compatible, for a start. Regarding license, it'll probably get changed for the bindings at some point, probably to 3-clause BSD.<br><br>On the wrapper generator: Really, the only actively maintained wrapper generator for Python that I'm aware of (which isn't project specific) is SWIG, which is not appropriate (at the very least, googling for 'python wrapper generator -swig' doesn't seem to give many results). In any case, the wrapper generator isn't a lot of code.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>I started to work on a newer and experimental OpenGL wrapper for Python,  proudly blessed PyOpenGLng.<br><br>In comparison to PyOpenGL, it generates the requested OpenGL API from the OpenGL XML Registry and use an automatic translator to map the C API to Python. The translator is quite light weight in comparison to PyOpenGL source code. And it is already able to run a couple of examples for OpenGL V3 and V4.<br><br>Actually the wrapper use ctypes. But I am looking for tips to do the same for cffi, as well as feedbacks on performance and comments.<br><br>The project is hosted on https://github.com/FabriceSalvaire/PyOpenGLng.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>I want to hear more talks on this.  When is your next talk... pycon 2014?  It would be hilarious if the pypy group were able to create naive concurrency in python, no one would have seen that coming!  Many would have thought, "surely Haskell", or some other immutable, static language would get us there first.  But no, it might just be that pypy allows any language that targets it to be concurrent, kiss style...amazing!  Anyway, enough gushing, time for a random question.  Mainstream vms like the JVM have added ways of speeding up dynamic languages, what advantages does pypy have over these traditional vms(other than the concurrency one that might come to fruition)?  I think this would be a good question to answer at the next talk for pypy.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>@Arne: Regarding Pyglet integration - it seems it would require a lot of work. There's two major issues - firstly, Pyglet only has raw OpenGL bindings, which are used everywhere and hence the "more pythonic" bindings of gl32 would be hard to integrate without editing every file using GL in Pyglet. Secondly, Pyglet uses GL functions which were removed in 3.2, and hence are not in gl32, so the API generator would have to be extended to handle any special cases on these functions.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>@anatoly<br><br>Pyglet's GL wrapper generator creates a lot of chained functions (fairly slow in cPython). I'm also not sure if there's enough development activity in Pyglet to allow modifying core code, and given the size of the Pyglet project I'm not going to fork it. PyOpenGL has more or less the same issues.<br><br>Regal appears to be a very large project (a 68MB checkout), which has a scope much greater than just its wrapper generator - the sheer scope of the project does cause some barriers to entry. I'm still looking through, but I am fairly certain that it would take more effort to adapt Regals binding generator than I have expended on my own.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>I believe the "performance optimizations" mentioned in the blog post are unrelated to BLAS.  BLAS is about calling an external library.  You can't optimize that, you just merely call it.  The performance optimizations are about things like computing the matrix "a + b + c", which can be done without computing the intermediate result "a + b".</p></body></html>

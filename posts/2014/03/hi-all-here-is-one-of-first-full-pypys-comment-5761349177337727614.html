<html><body><p>Indeed, which is the point :-)  You're welcome to try it out, but I'm just saying that I don't want to go to great lengths to provide precompiled binaries that work on Linux XYZ when I could basically release an updated version every couple of days...  It's still experimental and in-progress.  Early versions are limited to two cores; later versions to 4 cores.  We still have to determine the optimal number for this limit; maybe around 8? (higher numbers imply a bit of extra overheads)  It's an example of in-progress work.  Another example is that so far you don't get feedback from cross-transaction conflicts; you used to in previous versions, but we didn't port it yet.</p></body></html>

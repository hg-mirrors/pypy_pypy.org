<html><body><p>@Arne:<br><br>I'd argue that objects with Z-order would be more convenient programmatically, but frankly that's a matter of opinion. (Incidentally, this is something I'm working on as well, and I think I'm mostly done on it). <br><br>However, per-object-draw is only one concern I have on Pyglets speed credentials, as I do not believe Pyglet was written with speed as a design goal. For a different example, see pyglet.graphics.vertexbuffer; copying a ctypes object into a list in order to get slices to work is not a smart thing to do, performance wise!<br><br>I'm not sure where you got Python 3.2 from, but what I meant was that currently I'm restricting myself to OpenGL 3.2, which means that certain older OpenGL functions do not exist. Pyglet uses some of these removed functions (e.g. glPushClientAttrib), and hence the bindings I'm generating at the moment do not provide all the features Pyglet uses.</p></body></html>

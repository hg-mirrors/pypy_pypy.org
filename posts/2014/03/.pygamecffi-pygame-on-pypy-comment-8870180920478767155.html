<html><body><p>@Arne: In principal, PyPy seems to handle Pyglets chained functions relatively well (non-scientifically running the Astraea examples title screen sees CPU usage start very high, but eventually drops to about 80% of cPythons after the JIT warms up). There is one caveat preventing better testing: the moment keyboard input is given to Astraea on PyPy, PyPy segfaults.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>@Arne: It's as simple as running the Astraea example in Pyglet and pressing a key (under PyPy 2.2, Pyglet 1.2-beta, Ubuntu 14.04). As far as I remember, this has been the case for some time (at least as far back as Ubuntu 12.10/PyPy 2.0 beta - although back then the major issue was PyPy using a lot more CPU; I didn't report this then due to a blog post at the time saying how cTypes would be rewritten). The error reported by Apport is "Cannot access memory at address 0x20"<br><br>Doing a cursory scan through other examples, the noisy and text_input examples also have problems. noisy segfaults when a spawned ball collides with a boundary (occasionally giving a partial rpython traceback); text_input appears to have a random chance of any of the input boxes being selectable.<br><br>Maybe it's time to file a proper bug report on this...</p></body></html>

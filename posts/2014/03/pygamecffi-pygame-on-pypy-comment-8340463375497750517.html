<html><body><p>I'd like to remind readers of these comments that this thread has gone farther and farther from both the original post and the whole blog -- which is supposed to be related to PyPy.  I'm rather sure that you're now discussing performance on CPython, which in this case is very different from performance on PyPy (or would be if it supported all packages involved).  Maybe move this discussion somewhere more appropriate?</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>Oh, I do not want to know personally about the superiority of pypy vs the jvm.  I was just suggesting a talking point; basically, show others that pypy is a better alternative(for dynamic languages, possibly all languages with naive concurrency working!) then llvm, jvm, etc...  I do have a question though, would you suppose that performance of pypy-stm would be better than that of something like the approach clojure has?  I have heard that immutable data structures are nice for correctness but that they are bad for performance.</p></body></html>

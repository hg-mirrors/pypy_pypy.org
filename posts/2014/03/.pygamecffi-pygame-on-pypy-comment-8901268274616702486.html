<html><body><p>@Arne: Maybe it'd be worth looking at integrating it then; however, it really is a completely different approach - gl32 is a source code writer, whereas Pyglet uses Pythons inbuilt metaprogramming capabilities - and so it would be completely rewriting a large chunk of Pyglets core. Once I've got the binding generator finalised, it might be worth seeing if it's possible to replace Pyglet's OpenGL bindings with these ones.<br><br>That said, in the interest of full disclosure: I'm not a fan of Pyglets per object draw method, again in the interests of speed. The per object draw method that Pyglet encourages with its API is not very scalable and eliminates a large number of the advantages of using OpenGL. So whilst I might see if gl32 can be plugged in for interesting benchmarks/proof-of-concept, I probably wouldn't try to get it bug-free and integrated into upstream Pyglet.</p></body></html>

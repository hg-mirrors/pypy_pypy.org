For many of my applications, an important feature in the next phase will be the optimization for <i>[..] the built-in dictionary type, for which we would like accesses and writes using independent keys to be truly independent [..]</i>.  My applications are mostly server applications (Twisted-based and others) that store state information on sessions/transactions in a small number of dictionaries that can have hundreds or thousands of entries concurrently, and would be accessed constantly.<br><br>I'm glad I donated and plan do so again in the future :-)</p></body></html>

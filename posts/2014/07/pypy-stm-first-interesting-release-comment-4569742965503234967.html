<html><body><p>this is a question for the guys developing PyPy... i am completely new to Python so please bear with me.<br><br>here is what i don't understand:  it seems to me that you are reinventing the wheel because doesn't the Oracle or Azul Systems JVM already provide a super performant GC and JIT? even STM is becoming available.  and since Jython can run on the JVM, why do PyPy at all?  <br><br>wouldn't a JVM compliant implementation of Python be more performant than PyPy or CPython?<br><br>or am i missing something here?<br><br>any pointers greatly appreciated. thanks.</p></body></html>

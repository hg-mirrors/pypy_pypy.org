<html><body><p>This is exciting! One minor bug in the actual post: you can describe slowdown / speedup in two different ways, with <i>total time</i> as a percentage of original time, or with <i>time difference</i> as a percentage of original time. You mention a 20% slowdown (clearly using the latter standard) and then a 300% slowdown, which you describe as 3x (suggesting that you use the former standard). To be consistent , you should either describe them as 120% and 300%, respectively (using the former standard), or 20% and 200%, respectively (using the latter standard).<br><br>Thanks!</p></body></html>

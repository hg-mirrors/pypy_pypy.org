<html><body><p>PyPy does not hoist the buffer allocation here. The benchmark specifically allocated/frees the buffer every loop, since we want the object written fresh (otherwise pinning is not needed), but also we think that writing a new object (as opposed to the constant buffer) is really more of a common case. Yes, you get an overhead of allocation measured too, but the case here is that we wanted to measure the IO of fresh objects, not old ones</p></body></html>

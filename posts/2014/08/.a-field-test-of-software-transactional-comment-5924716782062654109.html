<html><body><p>I concur with Armin, the conclusions are problematic in the light of the current numbers.<br><br>Could you give some more details on the benchmarks? Can I find the Smalltalk code somewhere?<br><br>Things that come to mind are details about the scheduler. In the RoarVM, that was also one of the issues (which we did not solve). The standard Squeak scheduling data structure remains unchanged I suppose? How does that interact with the STM, is it problematic that each STM thread updates this shared data structure during every scheduling operation?<br><br>Also, more basic, are you making sure that the benchmark processes are running with highest priority (80, IIRC), to avoid interference with other processes in the image?<br><br>On the language level, something that could also have an impact on the results is closures. How are they implemented? I suppose similar to the way the CogVM implements them? I suppose, you make sure that closures are not shared between processes?<br><br>And finally, what kind of benchmark harness are you using? Did you have a look at SMark? (http://smalltalkhub.com/#!/~StefanMarr/SMark)<br>We used that one for the RoarVM, and it provides various options to do different kind of benchmarks, including weak-scaling benchmarks, which I would find more appropriate for scalability tests. Weak-scaling means, you increase the problem size with the number of cores. That replicates the scenario where the problem itself is not really parallelizable, but you can solve more problems at the same time in parallel. It also makes sure that each process/thread does the identical operations (if setup correctly).<br><br>Well, all those questions aside, interesting work :) Hope to read more soon ;)</p></body></html>

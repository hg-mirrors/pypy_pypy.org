<html><body><p>"We showed that an existing VM code base can benefit of STM in terms of scaling up."  I dispute this conclusion: in the benchmarks, it seems that the non-STM version is scaling up well, even better than the STM+OS-threads version.  But how can the non-STM version scale at all?  It shouldn't: that's a property of RPython.  And why is the STM+OS-threads version faster even with just 1 thread?  I think you need to answer these questions first.  Right now it screams "you are running buggy benchmarks" to me.</p></body></html>

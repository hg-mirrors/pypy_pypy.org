<html><body><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">We're pleased to announce the availability of PyPy3 2.4.0!<br>
<br>
This release contains several bugfixes and enhancements. Among the user-facing improvements specific to PyPy3:<br>
<ul><li>Better Windows compatibility, e.g. the nt module functions _getfinalpathname &amp; _getfileinformation are now supported (the former is required for the popular pathlib library for example)</li>
<li>Various fsencode PEP 383 related fixes to the posix module (readlink, uname, ttyname and ctermid) and improved locale handling</li>
<li>Switched the default binary name on POSIX distributions from 'pypy' to 'pypy3' (which symlinks to to 'pypy3.2')</li>
<li>Fixed a couple different crashes related to parsing Python 3 source code</li>
</ul><br>
And improvements shared with the recent PyPy 2.4.0 release:<br>
<ul style="text-align: left;"><li>internal refactoring in string and GIL handling which led to significant speedups</li>
<li>improved handling of multiple objects (like sockets) in long-running  programs. They are collected and released more efficiently, reducing  memory use. In simpler terms - we closed what looked like a memory leak</li>
<li>Windows builds now link statically to zlib, expat, bzip, and openssl-1.0.1i</li>
<li>Many issues were <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/issues?status=resolved">resolved</a> since the 2.3.1 release in June</li>
</ul><br>

<a href="http://www.pypy.org/">PyPy</a> is a very compliant Python interpreter, almost a drop-in replacement for <a href="https://www.python.org/">CPython</a> 2.7 and 3.2.5. It's fast (<a href="http://speed.pypy.org/">pypy 2.4 and cpython 2.7.x performance comparison</a>) due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.<br>
<br>
This  release supports x86 machines running Linux 32/64, Mac OS X 64,   Windows, and OpenBSD, as well as newer ARM hardware (ARMv6 or ARMv7,   with VFPv3) running Linux.  <br>
We would like to thank our donors for the continued support of the PyPy project.<br>

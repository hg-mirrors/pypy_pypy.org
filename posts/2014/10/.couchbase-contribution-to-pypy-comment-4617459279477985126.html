<html><body><p>Hello from Couchbase. With regards to making our code compatible with PyPy, I can only comment on our internal tooling. Those are currently all pure Python, so it was trivial. We used modules that work with PyPy already: namely pyparsing, LEPL, and tornado. The tools all run under both CPython and PyPy unmodified.</p></body></html>

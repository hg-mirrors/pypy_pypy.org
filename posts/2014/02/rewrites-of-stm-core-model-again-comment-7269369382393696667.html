<html><body><p>@Dina: Thanks for the feedback! Note that "%gs" is a special register that is usually not used: there is no direct way to read/write its actual value.  It needs to be done with a syscall, at least before very recent CPUs. It can only be used in addressing instructions as an additional offset.</p></body></html>

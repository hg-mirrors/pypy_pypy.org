<html><body><p>poll response: I've heard of remap_file_pages! :)<br><br>I was wondering how to use this call when I learnt of it, but couldn't figure anything out except possibly database applications (similar) and sort algorithms (too limited). I think this call may be used when manipulating framebuffer too, there was something about having multiple mappings [to hardware] some readonly, some not.<br><br>I would like to [possibly] disagree with your statement in c7 README "Most probably, this comes with no overhead once the change is done..."<br><br>TLB cache is a limited resource and may easily be contended on large systems. Regular mmap could [in theory] use huge TLB pages, remapped individual pages cannot.<br><br>In addition there is a small penalty during first access to the remapped page, though you may consider it amortized depending on remap/reuse ratio.<br><br>Granted it's still small stuff.<br><br>Reserving one register is is a cool trick, and I find quite acceptable. It too has a small penalty, but the benefits surely outweigh those!</p></body></html>

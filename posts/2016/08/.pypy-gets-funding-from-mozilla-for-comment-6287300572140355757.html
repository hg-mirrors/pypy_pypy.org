<html><body><p>TL;DR. Python 3.5 is a "good enough" and seems a future-proof language. <br><br>I was in charge of deciding which version of Python to use at my job. We started the development of a framework supporting Python 2.7 and Python &gt;=3.4, but we recently switched to a Python 3 only development. The whole python 2 vs 3 thing was quite confusing to the operations department and developers that are not proficient with Python. <br><br>There was a quite thorough assessment of the features, and we decided to stick to Python 3.5, at least for the next decade or so. On the Python 3 side, one of the reasons was that the async/await syntax allows junior developers to understand (more or less) asynchronous programming, while coroutines+decorators are quite a mess. We still have some Red Hat instances that use Python 3.4, but as soon as we get rid of them, everything will be Python 3.5.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>Great news! Pypy's lack of Python 3 support is the biggest reason I haven't switched yet. It technically supports most of 3.3 already, but since Pypy3 is slower than CPython, it may as well not exist. Hopefully you'll also work out the performance issues in Pypy 3 as well.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>Why Python 3.5 instead of 3.6?  That's because 3.5 is the version that attracts people.  Python 3.6 will only be out of beta in december and my own wild guess is that it won't immediately attract all the 2.7 people, who grew accustomed to sticking to a known unchanging version.  So the deal with Mozilla is to get a PyPy 3.5 working as well as possible; it is better than getting a PyPy 3.6 that (like current versions of PyPy 3) has downsides in completeness and performance.</p></body></html>

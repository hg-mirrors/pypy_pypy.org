<html><body><p>@PvdE: I'll admit that the STM-GC is not actively going anywhere right now.  STM is hard, unsurprizingly.  There is still a bit being done by Remi (working at an academic institution where he doesn't need the money).  For me, I am part of the Python 3.5 team, but I might also come back to STM-GC soon.  We expect not all our resources to be consumed by Python 3.5.  In fact, the money covers four half-time jobs (and flexibility allows someone to do less than half-time while someone else does more).</p></body></html>

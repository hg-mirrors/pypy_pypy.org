<html><body><p>This is great news.<br><br>A developer's decision to target Python 3 over Python 2 in their projects is more fundamental than deciding which interpreter to use. People use Python 3 because it's future-proof, to take advantage of its new features and to do their bit in driving the Python ecosystem forward. For me and I imagine many others, being curious about PyPy hasn't been enough to override all those factors.<br><br>I think there's a huge untapped audience out there waiting for first-class support for modern Python in PyPy before giving it a shot. I hope to see a big bump in PyPy adoption with this move, and a corresponding bump in funding and support for PyPy's development.<br><br>Thanks for your fantastic work!</p></body></html>

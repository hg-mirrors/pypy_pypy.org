We have released PyPy2.7 v5.4, a little under two months after PyPy2.7 v5.3.
This new PyPy2.7 release includes incremental improvements to our C-API
compatibility layer (cpyext), enabling us to pass over 99% of the upstream
numpy test suite.<br>
<br>
We updated built-in <a class="reference external" href="https://cffi.readthedocs.org/">cffi</a> support to version 1.8,
which now supports the “limited API” mode for c-extensions on
CPython &gt;=3.2.<br>

<br>
We improved tooling for the PyPy <a class="reference external" href="https://morepypy.blogspot.com.au/2016/08/pypy-tooling-upgrade-jitviewer-and.html">JIT</a>, and expanded VMProf
support to OpenBSD and Dragon Fly BSD<br>

<br>
As always, this release fixed many issues and bugs raised by the
growing community of PyPy users. We strongly recommend updating.<br>

We would like to thank our donors for their continued support of the PyPy
project. We would also like to thank our contributors and
encourage new people to join the project. PyPy has many
layers and we need help with all of them: <a class="reference external" href="http://doc.pypy.org/">PyPy</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.org/">RPython</a> documentation
improvements, testing and adapting popular <a class="reference external" href="http://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/project-ideas.html#make-more-python-modules-pypy-friendly">modules</a> to run on PyPy, or general <a class="reference external" href="http://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/project-ideas.html">help</a>
with making RPython’s JIT even better.<br>
<br>

What is PyPy?</h1>
PyPy is a very compliant Python interpreter, almost a drop-in replacement for CPython 2.7. It’s fast (<a class="reference external" href="http://speed.pypy.org/">PyPy and CPython 2.7</a> performance comparison) due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.<br>
<br>
We also welcome developers of other <a class="reference external" href="http://pypyjs.org/">dynamic languages</a> to see what RPython can do for them.<br>
<br>
This release supports:<br>
<ul class="simple">
<li><b>x86</b> machines on most common operating systems (Linux 32/64, Mac OS X 64, Windows 32, OpenBSD, FreeBSD)</li>
<li>newer <b>ARM</b> hardware (ARMv6 or ARMv7, with VFPv3) running Linux</li>
<li>big- and little-endian variants of <b>PPC64</b> running Linux</li>
<li><b>s390x</b> running Linux</li>
</ul>

What is New?</h1>
<h3>
(since the release of PyPy 5.3 in June, 2016)</h3>
There are many incremental improvements to RPython and PyPy, the complete listing is <a href="http://pypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/release-pypy2.7-v5.4.0.html">here</a>. Mozilla <a href="https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2016/08/pypy-gets-funding-from-mozilla-for.html">generously sponsored</a> work toward python 3.5 compatibility, and we are beginning to see some cross-over improvements of RPython and PyPy2.7 as a result.<br>
<br>
Please update, and continue to help us make PyPy better.
Cheers<br><br>
The PyPy Team</div></body></html>

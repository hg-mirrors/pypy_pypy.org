<html><body><p>This is amazing news! I use Python3 extensively in private research projects. Unfortunately, I have been in the position of choosing between Python3 and having a high-performance interpreter implementation. Testing the PyPy 3.3.5 alpha shows all-around disappointing performance in our string-manipulation-heavy projects making intense use of unicode, so I can only recommend our team to stay with CPython for both performance and compatibility. <br><br>I am very excited to hear that PyPy3 will be getting more of the specific attention it deserves, with Python 3.5 support to boot!<br></p></body></html>

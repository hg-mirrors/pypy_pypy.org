<html><body><p>This is huge news!  Corporate sponsorship of open source projects is a beautiful thing for us all.  Congrats to the PyPy team.  You really deserve this kind of support for all of your hard work and perseverance over the years.<br><br>Given that Python 3.6 will be going beta next month, perhaps that should be your target instead of 3.5 but you know your craft better than I do.<br><br>Those of you who would be interested to <b>pay Mozilla back for this investment</b> might want to help port the following 9 Mozilla projects to Python 3:<br>* mozrunner, moznetwork, mozdevice, mozprocess, mozprofile, mozfile, mozinfo, mozlog, mozcrash<br><br>    These nine Python 2 projects are all in the Top 150 PyPI downloads of all time and each of them has been downloaded with pip more than 5 million times.  Currently 92% of the Top 200 PyPI packages are Python3 compatible.  Converting these 9 Mozbase modules to Python 3 would bump that number up to 96.5%.  It would also probably push us over the line where 50% of the Top 4,000 PyPI packages are Python 3 compatible.  This kind of momentum would be welcome news as the Python community continues our move to Python 3.</p></body></html>

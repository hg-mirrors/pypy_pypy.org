<html><body><p>"Python 2.x versus Python 3.x": this is by now an old question.  In the eyes of some people Python 2 is here to stay, and in the eyes of others Python has long been 3 only.</p>

<p>PyPy's own position is that PyPy will support Python 2.7 forever---the RPython language in which PyPy is written is a subset of  2.7, and we have no plan to upgrade that.  But at the same time, we want to support 3.x.  This is particularly true now: a relatively recent development is that Python 3.5 seems to attract more and more people.  The "switch" to Python 3.x might be starting to happen.</p>

<p>Correspondingly, PyPy has been searching for a while for a way to support a larger-scale development effort.  The goal is to support not just any old version of Python 3.x, but Python 3.5, as this seems to be the version that people are switching to.  PyPy is close to supporting all of Python 3.3 now; but the list of what is new in Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.4.html">3.4</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.5.html">3.5</a> is far, far longer than anyone imagines.  The long-term goal is also to get a version of "PyPy3" that is as good as "PyPy2" is, including its performance and its cpyext layer (CPython C API interoperability), for example.</p>

<p>So, the end result: <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2016/08/04/mozilla-awards-585000-to-nine-open-source-projects-in-q2-2016/">Mozilla recently decided to award $200,000</a> to <a href="http://baroquesoftware.com/">Baroque Software</a> to work on PyPy as part of its Mozilla Open Source Support (MOSS) initiative.  This money will be used to implement the Python 3.5 features in PyPy. Within the next year, we plan to use the money to pay four core PyPy developers half-time to work on the missing features and on some of the big performance and cpyext issues. This should speed up the progress of catching up with Python 3.x significantly. We are extremely thankful to Mozilla for supporting us in this way, and will keep you updated on the progress via this blog.</p></body></html>

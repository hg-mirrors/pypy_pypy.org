<html><body><p>As you are talking about GCC beating your JIT, you are using your own vectorizing compiler right?<br>I wonder if this is a feasible approach. Can you really compete with the years if not decades of work that went into the vectorizers of GCC and LLVM?<br>Wouldn't it make more sense to plug into GCC's and LLVM's JIT API's (yes GCC has a JIT) for this type of code?<br>What does PyPy bring to the table that the existing JIT's do not for numerical code?</p></body></html>

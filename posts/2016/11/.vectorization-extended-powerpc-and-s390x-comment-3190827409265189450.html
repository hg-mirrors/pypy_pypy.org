<html><body><p>It's good to see pypy making progress on using python as a toolkit for data science. In addition to numpy, pandas/scipy also needs to work well for me to switch. <br><br>Also, a lot of data science is currently being run on windows and the x64 port of pypy hasn't had much traction in the last several years. If these 2 issues are solved (pandas/scipy being supported on a x64 windows pypy) then there should be no reason to keep using CPython.</p></body></html>

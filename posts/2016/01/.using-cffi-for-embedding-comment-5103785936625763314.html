<html><body><p>Thanks to apollo13 on irc for early feedback.  Main change: the code put in embedded_init_code() should now start with "from xx import ffi", where "xx" is the name of the module (first argument to set_source()).  The goal is to clearly say that you need the same line in other modules imported from there.</p></body></html>

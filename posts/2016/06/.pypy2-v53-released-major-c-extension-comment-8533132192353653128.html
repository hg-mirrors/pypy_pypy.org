<html><body><p>No special instructions, just build from source (binaries precompiled for cpython will not work) using "pypy setup.py install", and let us know how it goes. The order should be numpy, matplotlib, scipy (we have reports that pygtk works too fwiw). <br><br>There have already been some bug reports, so you might want to patch your pymem.h header in pypy/include with this changeset https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/commits/68486f0f79c649514, and if you are on OSX you may need to patch numpy/distutils/fcompiler/gnu.py  with this patch  https://bitbucket.org/pypy/numpy/commits/50bff5807e09721acc4d778ce8ffdef86e2f4c50</p></body></html>

<span style="font-size: x-large;">PyPy 5.0.1</span></h2>
<br>
We have released a bugfix for PyPy 5.0, after reports that the newly released
<a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lxml/3.6.0">lxml 3.6.0</a>, which now supports PyPy 5.0 +, can <a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues/2260">crash on large files</a>.
Thanks to those who reported the crash. Please update, downloads are available
at<br>
<br>
<a href="pypy.org/download.html">pypy.org/download.html</a><br>

<br>
The changes between PyPy 5.0 and 5.0.1 are only two bug fixes: one in
cpyext, which fixes notably (but not only) lxml; and another for a
corner case of the JIT.<br>
<br>

What is PyPy?</h3>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<br></div>
PyPy is a very compliant Python interpreter, almost a drop-in replacement for
CPython 2.7. Itâ€™s fast (<a class="reference external" href="http://speed.pypy.org/">PyPy and CPython 2.7.x</a> performance comparison)
due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.<br>

We also welcome developers of other
<a class="reference external" href="http://pypyjs.org/">dynamic languages</a> to see what RPython can do for them.<br>

This release supports <strong>x86</strong> machines on most common operating systems
(Linux 32/64, Mac OS X 64, Windows 32, OpenBSD, FreeBSD),
newer <strong>ARM</strong> hardware (ARMv6 or ARMv7, with VFPv3) running Linux, and the
big- and little-endian variants of <strong>PPC64</strong> running Linux.<br>

<br>
Please update, and continue to help us make PyPy better.<br>

<br>
Cheers<br>

The PyPy Team<br>

We would like to thank our donors for the continued support of the PyPy project.<br>
We would also like to thank our contributors and encourage new people to join the project. PyPy has many layers and we need help with all of them: <a class="reference external" href="http://doc.pypy.org/">PyPy</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.org/">RPython</a> documentation improvements, tweaking popular <a class="reference external" href="http://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/project-ideas.html#make-more-python-modules-pypy-friendly">modules</a> to run on pypy, or general <a class="reference external" href="http://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/project-ideas.html">help</a> with making RPython’s JIT even better.<br>

Faster and Leaner</h3>
<div class="section" id="new-version-numbering">
We continue to improve the warmup time and memory usage of JIT-related metadata. The exact effects depend vastly on the program you’re running and can range from insignificant to warmup being up to 30% faster and memory dropping by about 30%. </div>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">

<h3 style="text-align: center;">
C-API Upgrade</h3>
<div class="section" id="vectorization">
We also merged a major upgrade to our C-API layer (cpyext), simplifying the interaction between c-level objects and PyPy interpreter level objects. As a result, lxml  (prerelease) with its cython compiled component <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/compatibility/wiki/lxml">passes all tests</a> on PyPy. The new cpyext is also much faster. This major refactoring will soon be followed by an expansion of our C-API compatibility.</div>

Profiling with vmprof supported on more platforms</h3>
<br>
<div class="section" id="internal-refactoring-and-warmup-time-improvement">
<a class="reference external" href="http://vmprof.readthedocs.org/">vmprof</a> has been a go-to profiler for PyPy on linux for a few releases and we’re happy to announce that thanks to the cooperation with jetbrains, vmprof now works on Linux, OS X and Windows on both PyPy and CPython.</div>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">
CFFI</h3>
While not applicable only to PyPy, <a class="reference external" href="https://cffi.readthedocs.org/">cffi</a> is arguably our most significant contribution to the python ecosystem. PyPy 5.0 ships with <a class="reference external" href="http://cffi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/whatsnew.html#v1-5-2">cffi-1.5.2</a> which now allows embedding PyPy (or CPython) in a C program.</div>

What is PyPy?</h3>
<br>
PyPy is a very compliant Python interpreter, almost a drop-in replacement for CPython 2.7. It’s fast (<a class="reference external" href="http://speed.pypy.org/">pypy and cpython 2.7.x</a> performance comparison) due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.<br>
We also welcome developers of other <a class="reference external" href="http://pypyjs.org/">dynamic languages</a> to see what RPython can do for them.<br>
This release supports <b>x86</b> machines on most common operating systems (Linux 32/64, Mac OS X 64, Windows 32, <a class="reference external" href="http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/ports/lang/pypy">OpenBSD</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/lang/pypy/">freebsd</a>), newer <b>ARM</b> hardware (ARMv6 or ARMv7, with VFPv3) running Linux, and <b>64 bit PowerPC </b>hardware, specifically Linux running the big- and little-endian variants of ppc64.</div>

Other Highlights (since 4.0.1 released in November 2015)</h3>
<ul class="simple" style="text-align: left;">
<li>New features:<ul>
<li>Support embedding PyPy in a C-program via cffi and static callbacks in cffi.<br>
This deprecates the old method of embedding PyPy</li>
<li>Refactor vmprof to work cross-operating-system, deprecate using buggy<br>
libunwind on Linux platforms. Vmprof even works on Windows now.</li>
<li>Support more of the C-API type slots, like tp_getattro, and fix C-API<br>
macros, functions, and structs such as _PyLong_FromByteArray(),<br>
PyString_GET_SIZE, f_locals in PyFrameObject, Py_NAN, co_filename in<br>
PyCodeObject</li>
<li>Use a more stable approach for allocating PyObjects in cpyext. (see<br>
<a class="reference external" href="http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2016/02/c-api-support-update.html">blog post</a>). Once the PyObject corresponding to a PyPy object is created,<br>
it stays around at the same location until the death of the PyPy object.<br>
Done with a little bit of custom GC support.  It allows us to kill the<br>
notion of “borrowing” inside cpyext, reduces 4 dictionaries down to 1, and<br>
significantly simplifies the whole approach (which is why it is a new<br>
feature while technically a refactoring) and allows PyPy to support the<br>
populart lxml module (as of the <i>next</i> release) with no PyPy specific<br>
patches needed</li>
<li>Make the default filesystem encoding ASCII, like CPython</li>
<li>Use <a class="reference external" href="http://hypothesis.readthedocs.org/">hypothesis</a> in test creation, which is great for randomizing tests</li>
</ul>
 <ul>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bug Fixes<ul>
<li>Backport always using os.urandom for uuid4 from cpython and fix the JIT as well<br>
(issue #2202)</li>
<li>More completely support datetime, optimize timedelta creation</li>
<li>Fix for issue #2185 which caused an inconsistent list of operations to be<br>
generated by the unroller, appeared in a complicated DJango app</li>
<li>Fix an elusive issue with stacklets on shadowstack which showed up when<br>
forgetting stacklets without resuming them</li>
<li>Fix entrypoint() which now acquires the GIL</li>
<li>Fix direct_ffi_call() so failure does not bail out before setting CALL_MAY_FORCE</li>
<li>Fix (de)pickling long values by simplifying the implementation</li>
<li>Fix RPython rthread so that objects stored as threadlocal do not force minor<br>
GC collection and are kept alive automatically. This improves perfomance of<br>
short-running Python callbacks and prevents resetting such object between<br>
calls</li>
<li>Support floats as parameters to itertools.isslice()</li>
<li>Check for the existence of CODESET, ignoring it should have prevented PyPy<br>
from working on FreeBSD</li>
<li>Fix for corner case (likely shown by Krakatau) for consecutive guards with<br>
interdependencies</li>
<li>Fix applevel bare class method comparisons which should fix pretty printing<br>
in IPython</li>
<li>Issues reported with our previous release were <a class="reference external" href="http://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/whatsnew-5.0.0.html">resolved</a> after reports from users on our issue tracker at <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/issues">https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/issues</a> or on IRC at #pypy</li>
</ul>
 <ul>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Numpy:<ul>
<li>Updates to numpy 1.10.2 (incompatibilities and not-implemented features<br>
still exist)</li>
<li>Support dtype=((‘O’, spec)) union while disallowing record arrays with<br>
mixed object, non-object values</li>
<li>Remove all traces of micronumpy from cpyext if –withoutmod-micronumpy option used</li>
<li>Support indexing filtering with a boolean ndarray</li>
<li>Support partition() as an app-level function, together with a cffi wrapper<br>
in pypy/numpy, this now provides partial support for partition()</li>
</ul>
 <ul>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Performance improvements:<ul>
<li>Optimize global lookups</li>
<li>Improve the memory signature of numbering instances in the JIT. This should<br>
massively decrease the amount of memory consumed by the JIT, which is<br>
significant for most programs. Also compress the numberings using variable-<br>
size encoding</li>
<li>Optimize string concatenation</li>
<li>Use INT_LSHIFT instead of INT_MUL when possible</li>
<li>Improve struct.unpack by casting directly from the underlying buffer.<br>
Unpacking floats and doubles is about 15 times faster, and integer types<br>
about 50% faster (on 64 bit integers). This was then subsequently<br>
improved further in optimizeopt.py.</li>
<li>Optimize two-tuple lookups in mapdict, which improves warmup of instance<br>
variable access somewhat</li>
<li>Reduce all guards from int_floordiv_ovf if one of the arguments is constant</li>
<li>Identify permutations of attributes at instance creation, reducing the<br>
number of bridges created</li>
<li>Greatly improve re.sub() performance</li>
</ul>
 <ul>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Internal refactorings:<ul>
<li>Refactor and improve exception analysis in the annotator</li>
<li>Remove unnecessary special handling of space.wrap().</li>
<li>Support list-resizing setslice operations in RPython</li>
<li>Tweak the trace-too-long heuristic for multiple jit drivers</li>
<li>Refactor bookkeeping (such a cool word - three double letters) in the<br>
annotater</li>
<li>Refactor wrappers for OS functions from rtyper to rlib and simplify them</li>
<li>Simplify backend loading instructions to only use four variants</li>
<li>Simplify GIL handling in non-jitted code</li>
<li>Refactor naming in optimizeopt</li>
<li>Change GraphAnalyzer to use a more precise way to recognize external<br>
functions and fix null pointer handling, generally clean up external<br>
function handling</li>
<li>Remove pure variants of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">getfield_gc_*</span></code> operations from the JIT by<br>
determining purity while tracing</li>
<li>Refactor databasing</li>
<li>Simplify bootstrapping in cpyext</li>
<li>Refactor rtyper debug code into python.rtyper.debug</li>
<li>Seperate structmember.h from Python.h Also enhance creating api functions<br>
to specify which header file they appear in (previously only pypy_decl.h)</li>
<li>Fix tokenizer to enforce universal newlines, needed for Python 3 support</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

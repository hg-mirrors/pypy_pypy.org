<html><body><p>Hi Paul.<br><br>We rerun all benchmarks on old Pythons and it shows now a different subset of benchmarks. I must admit I don't know why the main site chooses some benchmarks and not others, it's certainly not deliberate. Any single number you use is not correct, a bit by definition - we suggest you look in details what the benchmarks do or even better, benchmark yourself. We'll look why it's showing a different subset</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>Those benchmarks are very synthetic warmup-oriented ones. It means you exec() piece of code and then run it 2000 times and then exec again. Any other short-running programs have a lot more noise where you have multiple effects taking place and it would be really hard to compare between old and new pypy. That said it's a fair requirement, we have one more branch in the pipeline and I'll try to get more real world data.</p></body></html>

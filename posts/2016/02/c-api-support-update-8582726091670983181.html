<p>The C-API is implemented by passing around <code>PyObject *</code> pointers in the C code.  The problem with providing the same interface with PyPy is that
objects don't natively have the same <code>PyObject *</code> structure at all; and
additionally their memory address can change.  PyPy handles the
difference by maintaining two sets of objects.  More precisely, starting
from a PyPy object, it can allocate on demand a <code>PyObject</code> structure
and fill it with information that points back to the original PyPy
objects; and conversely, starting from a C-level object, it can allocate
a PyPy-level object and fill it with information in the opposite
direction.</p>

<p>I have merged a rewrite of the interaction between C-API C-level objects
and PyPy's interpreter level objects.  This is mostly a simplification
based on a small hack in our garbage collector.  This hack makes the
garbage collector aware of the reference-counted <code>PyObject</code>
structures.  When it considers a pair consisting of a PyPy object and a
<code>PyObject</code>, it will always free either none or both of them at the
same time.  They both stay alive if <i>either</i> there is a regular GC
reference to the PyPy object, <i>or</i> the reference counter in the
<code>PyObject</code> is bigger than zero.</p>

<p>This gives a more stable result.  Previously, a PyPy object might grow a
corresponding <code>PyObject</code>, loose it (when its reference counter goes to
zero), and later have another corresponding <code>PyObject</code> re-created at a
different address.  Now, once a link is created, it remains alive until
both objects die.</p>

<p>The rewrite significantly simplifies our previous code (which used to be
based on at least 4 different dictionaries), and should make using the
C-API somewhat faster (though it is still slower than using pure
python or cffi).</p>

<p>A side effect of this work is that now PyPy actually supports the upstream <a href="https://github.com/lxml/lxml">lxml</a> package---which is is one
of the most popular packages on PyPI.  (Specifically, you need version
3.5.0 with <a href="https://github.com/lxml/lxml/pull/187">this pull
request</a> to remove old PyPy-specific hacks that were not really
working.  <a href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/compatibility/wiki/lxml">See
details</a>.)  At this point, we no longer recommend using the
<code>cffi-lxml</code> alternative: although it may still be faster, it might be
incomplete and old.</p>

<p>We are actively working on extending our C-API support, and hope to soon
merge a branch to support more of the C-API functions (some numpy news
coming!).  Please <a href="http://buildbot.pypy.org/nightly/trunk/">try
it out</a> and let us know how it works for you.</p>

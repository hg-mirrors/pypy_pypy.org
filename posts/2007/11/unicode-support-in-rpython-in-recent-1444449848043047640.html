<html><body><p>In the recent days we (Carl Friedrich, Anto and me) implemented native unicode support for RPython. This means that now you can write u'xxxx' directly in your RPython program, as well as unicode(some_string_variable) and most of the unicode methods should work as well. The things that don't work, are operations that require the unicode database (such as .upper() and friends) and encodings (unicode(x, encoding) for example). Right now our python interpreter does not use this at all, but that's the next step.

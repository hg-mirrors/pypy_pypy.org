<html><body><p>I'm a little late, but regarding the simple let's-do-the-loop-concurrently example, if pypy-stm ends up working out as hoped, would it be relatively easy for pypy to do it automatically without having to use parallel loop thing explicitly?<br><br>I have a hunch the answer would be yes, but that the hard part is figuring out when it makes sense and how to do the split (each thread needs a good chunk to work on).<br><br>On the other hand, GCC has OpenMP which does seem really convenient and also looks like it has (or rather an implementation of that would have to have) solved part of this problem.<br><br>Many years ago, I read about research in auto-parallellising compilers and it stroke me as a really hard problem. But if you can just do some magic with the loops, perhaps it's an attainable goal?</p></body></html>

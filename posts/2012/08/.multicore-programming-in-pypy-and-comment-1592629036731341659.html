<html><body><p>I get the overall goals and desires and I think they are fabulous. However, one notion that seems counterintuitive to me is the desire for large atomic operations.<br><br>Aside from the nomenclature (atomic generally means smallest possible), my intuition is that STM would generally operate more efficiently by having fewer roll-backs with small atomic operations and frequent commits. This leads me to assume there is some sort of significant overhead involved with the setup or teardown of the STM 'wrapper'.<br><br>From a broader perspective, I get that understanding interlacing is much easier with larger pieces, but larger pieces of code don't lend themselves to wide distribution across many cores like small pieces do.<br><br>It seems, to me, that you're focusing heavily on the idea of linearly written code magically functioning in parallel and neglecting the idea of simple, low-cost concurrency, which might have a much bigger short-term impact; and which, through use, may shed light on better frameworks for reducing the complexity inherent in concurrency.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>Transactional programming is neat.  So are Goroutines and functional-style parallelism.  On the other hand, I think that C and C++ (or at least C1x and C++11) get one thing completely right: they don't try to enforce any particular threading model.  For some problems (like reference counts, as you mention), you really do want a different model.  As long as other languages force me to choose a single model, my big projects will stay in C/C++.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>Hi everybody,</p>
<p>We released <a class="reference external" href="http://cffi.readthedocs.org">CFFI 0.3</a>.  This is the first release that supports more
than CPython 2.x <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">:-)</span></tt></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>CPython 2.6, 2.7, and <strong>3.x</strong> are supported (3.3 definitely, but maybe 3.2 or earlier too)</li>
<li><strong>PyPy trunk</strong> is supported.</li>
</ul>
<p>In more details, the main news are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>support for PyPy.  You need to get a trunk version of PyPy, which
comes with the built-in module <tt class="docutils literal">_cffi_backend</tt> to use with the CFFI
release.  For testing, you can download the <a class="reference external" href="http://buildbot.pypy.org/nightly/trunk/">Linux 32/64 versions of
PyPy trunk</a>.  The OS/X and Windows versions of <tt class="docutils literal">_cffi_backend</tt>
are not tested at all so far, so probably don't work yet.</li>
<li>support for Python 3.  It is unknown which exact version is
required; probably 3.2 or even earlier, but we need 3.3 to run the
tests.  The 3.x version is not a separate source; it runs out of the same sources.  Thanks Amaury for starting this port.</li>
<li>the main change in the API is that you need to use <tt class="docutils literal">ffi.string(cdata)</tt>
instead of <tt class="docutils literal">str(cdata)</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">unicode(cdata)</tt>.  The motivation for this
change was the Python 3 compatibility.  If your Python 2 code used to
contain <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">str(&lt;cdata</span> 'char <span class="pre">*'&gt;)</span></tt>, it would interpret the memory content
as a null-terminated string; but on Python 3 it would just return a
different string, namely <tt class="docutils literal">"&lt;cdata 'char <span class="pre">*'&gt;"</span></tt>, and proceed without even
a crash, which is bad.  So ffi.string() solves it by always returning
the memory content as an 8-bit string (which is a str in Python 2 and
a bytes in Python 3).</li>
<li>other minor API changes are documented at
<a class="reference external" href="http://cffi.readthedocs.org/">http://cffi.readthedocs.org/</a> (grep for <tt class="docutils literal">version 0.3</tt>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Upcoming work, to be done before release 1.0:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>expose to the user the module <tt class="docutils literal">cffi.model</tt> in a possibly refactored
way, for people that don't like (or for some reason can't easily use)
strings containing snippets of C declarations.  We are thinking about
refactoring it in such a way that it has a ctypes-compatible
interface, to ease porting existing code from ctypes to cffi.  Note
that this would concern only the C type and function declarations, not
all the rest of ctypes.</li>
<li>CFFI 1.0 will also have a corresponding PyPy release.  We are thinking
about calling it PyPy 2.0 and including the whole of CFFI (instead of
just the <tt class="docutils literal">_cffi_backend</tt> module like now).  In other words it will
support CFFI out of the box --- we want to push forward usage of CFFI
in PyPy <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">:-)</span></tt></li>
</ul>
<p>Cheers,</p>

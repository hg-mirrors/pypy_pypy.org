<p>Hello everyone.</p>
<p>Not much has happened in the past few months with numpypy development. A part
of the reason was <a class="reference external" href="http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2012/07/hello-everyone.html">doing other stuff</a> for me, a part of the reason was
various unexpected visa-related admin, a part of the reason was EuroPython
and a part was long-awaited holiday.</p>
<p>The thing that's maybe worth mentioning is that it does not mean the donations
disappeared in the mist. PyPy developers are being paid to work on NumPyPy on
an hourly basis - that means if I decide to take holidays or work on something
else, the money is simply staying in the account until later.</p>
<p>Thanks again for all the donations, I hope to get back to this topic soon!</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
fijal</p>

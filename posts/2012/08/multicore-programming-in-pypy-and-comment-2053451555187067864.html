<html><body><p>@Mark D.: I don't know if "a dozen memory modification" comes from real work in the field or is just a guess.  My own guess would be that Intel Haswell supports easily hunderds of modifications, possibly thousands.  Moreover the built-in cache coherency mechanisms should be used here too, in a way that scales with the cache size; this means they should not be "prohibitively expensive".<br>Of course I know that in 0.1 seconds we do far more than thousands writes, but I think that nothing strictly limits the progression of future processors in that respect.<br><br>The occurrence of conflicts in large transactions depends on two factors.  First, "true conflicts", which is the hard problem, but which I think should be relatively deterministic and debuggable with new tools.  Second, "false conflicts", which is the HTM/STM mechanism detecting a conflict when there is none.  To handle large transactions this should occur with a probability very, very close to 0% for each memory access.  In pypy-stm it is 0%, but indeed, with HTM it depends on how close to 0% they can get.  I have no data on that.</p></body></html>

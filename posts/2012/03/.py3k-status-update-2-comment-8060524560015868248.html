<html><body><p>@Larry: yes, I've considered that, but as Nick says we are targeting 3.2, so it's much easier to just kill it in the meantime. Adding it back will be very easy.<br><br>@Nick: yes, using importlib is something which I also have considered. However, I'd prefer not to diverge too much from the "default" branch (because we are going to regularly merge default into py3k for a long time). I suppose that as long as the current importing logic works fine, we'll keep it :-)</p></body></html>

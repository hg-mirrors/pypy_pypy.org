<html><body><p>I solved a similar issue in Python 3.2. Python 3 did use the wrong encoding to encode/decode filenames. When I tried to use the filesystem encoding instead, I had an ugly bootstrap issue with encodings implemented in Python (whereas ASCII, latin1 and utf-8 are implemented in C with a fast-path).<br><br>The solution is to use C function to encode to/decode from the locale encoding, because the filesystem encoding is the locale encoding. mbstowcs() and wcstombs() are used until the Python codec machinery is ready.</p></body></html>

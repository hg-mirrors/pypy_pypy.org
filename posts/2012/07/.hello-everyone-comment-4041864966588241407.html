<html><body><p>Love this effort and esp. the benchmarks! Great work<br><br>Referring to your mentioning of JVM and parrot:<br><br>You consider as disadvantage to be tied to an existing set of VM opcodes to implement many languages. You were talking about .NET (which had to add Iron-style dynamic reflection later) or the JVM.<br><br>parrot already has all the functionality the JVM or .NET was missing and even more (e.g. dynamic types loadable as plugins) and considers it as advantage to share opcodes and bytecode libraries across different languages.<br><br>But parrot cannot compete with your speed yet.</p></body></html>

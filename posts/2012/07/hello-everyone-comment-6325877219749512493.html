<html><body><p>I hope you get funding for researching the refcount thing. Being able to predict when something gets whacked is just really convenient and something PyPy Python can benefit from too.<br><br>While GC may be more efficient, the unpredictable nature of it do become a problem in production in some cases.<br><br>For instance, for a webapp written with Django and CPython, when a request is over I know that the stuff that was allocated is now gone unless I put something in a global data structure. I suspect many applications have similar patterns where you perform a big operation after which it's natural to have a clean up.</p></body></html>

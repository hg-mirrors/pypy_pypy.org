<html><body><p>Just in case anyone *is* interested in implementing PHP on the Parrot Virtual Machine, you don't have to tie yourself to the PVM bytecodes.<br><br>You can write your PHP compiler entirely in NQP (Not Quite Perl) which in turn produces parrot bytecode for you.<br><br>This is important for two reasons:<br><br>First, NQP is a mid level language, and is relatively easy to write in, and doesn't require you to know anything at all about the PVM.<br><br>Second, although NQP *presently* only targets PVM, there's an in-progress backend which targets the Java Virtual Machine!  Early benchmarks suggest that it is already faster than perl5, and there are many optimizations and speedups to come.<br><br>Thus, if you were to write a PHP compiler in NQP, you could target either the Parrot Virtual machine, or (in the future) the Java virtual machine.</p></body></html>

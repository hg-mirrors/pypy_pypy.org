<html><body><p>@Piotr: the work in the py3k branch is destroying some of the python2 semantics, so we won't merge the twos as long as we support python2 (and we'll do it for a long time, because pypy itself is written in python2).<br>The current plan is just to keep the development in parallel, and regularly merge "default" into "py3k".</p></body></html>

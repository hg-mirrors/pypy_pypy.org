<html><body><a href="http://tratt.net/laurie">Laurence Tratt</a> from King's College London has written a long and detailed introduction to the <a href="http://tratt.net/laurie/tech_articles/articles/fast_enough_vms_in_fast_enough_time">goals and significance of RPython</a> over on <a href="http://tratt.net/laurie/tech_articles/">his blog</a>. Laurie has been implementing his <a href="http://convergepl.org/">Converge Language</a> in RPython in the last months. He is one of the first people external to the PyPy team who have pushed a sizeable RPython-based VM quite far, adding and tuning JIT hints. The post describes some of that work and his impressions of RPython and PyPy.<br>

"RPython, to my mind, is an astonishing project. It has, almost single-handedly, opened up an entirely new approach to VM implementation. As my experience shows, creating a decent RPython VM is not a huge amount of work (despite some frustrations). In short: never again do new languages need come with unusably slow VMs. That the the PyPy / RPython team have shown that these ideas scale up to a fast implementation of a large, real-world language (Python) is another feather in their cap."Â  </blockquote></body></html>

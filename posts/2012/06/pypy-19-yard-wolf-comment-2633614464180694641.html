<html><body><p>I have took a look at the mentioned numpypy table (http://buildbot.pypy.org/numpy-status/latest.html), and it lies in many ways. At first, some methods marked as "done" and undone yet, e.g. consider searchsorted: <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from numpypy import searchsorted<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; searchsorted([1,2,3],[2,3])<br>Traceback (most recent call last):<br>  File "", line 1, in <br>  File "/home/dmitrey/Install/pypy-c-jit-55492-ac392fb76904-linux/lib_pypy/numpypy/core/fromnumeric.py", line 763, in searchsorted<br>    raise NotImplementedError('Waiting on interp level method')<br>NotImplementedError: Waiting on interp level method<br><br>(and AFAIK there are many other similar numpypy funcs that are present in dir(numpypy), but only raise NotImplementedError).<br><br>At 2nd, some funcs like all and any, also mentioned there as "done", don't work with "axis" parameter and thus also should be unmarked.<br><br>FYI as a temporary replacement for some missing in PyPy yet numpy funcs (atleast_1d, atleast_2d, hstack, vstack, cumsum, isscalar, asscalar, asfarray, flatnonzero, tile, zeros_like, ones_like, empty_like, where, searchsorted;<br>    with "axis" parameter: nan(arg)min, nan(arg)max, all, any ) <br><br>I have implemented them in AppLevel (thus PyPy developers refuce to commit them, but some users could be interested right now), see http://openopt.org/PyPy for more details and my sincere opinion on the situation.<br><br>Best wishes for PyPy developers and users, D.</p></body></html>

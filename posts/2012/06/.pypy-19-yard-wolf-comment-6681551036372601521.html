<html><body><p>hi fijal,<br>as far as I remember, main reasons of PyPy developers (I don't remember namely) to reject my funcs propositions were AppLevel vs InterpLevel, not corner testcases (they even said "don't start the func, it must be InterpLevel"). Thus to speedup OpenOpt port on PyPy I went other way and as you probably have seen that some OpenOpt Suite functionality is already available in PyPy and works some times faster.<br><br>If apperplevel is ok for some of those funcs mentioned above, you or any other PyPy programmer can take anything from the code; as for me, I have lots of other things to do with my projects, especially now, before regular release, and thus cannot allocate time to create testcases for the numpy funcs.<br><br>BTW, what about fancy indexing with int arrays (https://bugs.pypy.org/issue1130) - when it will be implemented? It's very important for many Python projects and hangs for a long time already.</p></body></html>

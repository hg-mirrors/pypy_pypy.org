<html><body><p>@Matthias: there are several follow-up posts planned to explain everything in detail, so just a few quick answers now.<br><br>Pythonizations are handled automatically based on signature, otherwise by allowing user defined pythonization functions.<br><br>Template instantiations are still needed in the Reflex world, but with CLang/LLVM, those can be generated by the backend (CINT can perform the instantiations automatically as well).<br><br>Object ownership can be handled heuristically if the C++ side behaves (this is e.g. the case for most of ROOT). If that's not the case, extra annotations per function or per object are needed. In addition, communication with the memory regulator (a tracker of all proxies on the python side) through a callback on both sides is possible.<br><br>Type mappings happen through custom converters that are to be coded up in either Python or C++. Standard mappings (e.g. the use of std::string in the way that you describe for MyString) have been added by default. Type mappings can also be done based on signature in some cases.<br><br>Not everything of the above is implemented in cppyy yet, but all have been solved before in PyROOT on CPython. It's just a matter of time to implement things for cppyy. The important point, however, is that none of this needs a separate language: most of it can be handled automatically, with a little work of the programmer in python proper or, worst case, with a C++ helper.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Wim</p></body></html>

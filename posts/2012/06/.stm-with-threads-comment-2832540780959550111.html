<html><body><p>@Paul: my guess would be that the majority of people that know STM are still looking at it from the point of view of short or very short transactions, as a replacement of locking.  Even gcc 4.7 got an STM extension, but it cannot be used with long-running transactions: the performance is not at all tuned for this case, and you cannot express things you need in real long-running transactions, like interrupting them for I/O.<br><br>Moreover the single-core 4x performance hit is usually far more that what people are willing to accept --- not realizing that in many cases it will soon be outdated, as a way of measuring performance: the future is toward many-cores machines.</p></body></html>

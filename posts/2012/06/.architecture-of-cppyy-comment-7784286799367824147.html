<html><body><p>From my past experience wrapping a C++ library to python is a whole lot more than just being able to call functions and having objects. <br><br>For example using a binding generator like SWIG you need to annotate your source, because the source alone does not have sufficient information to generate proper bindings (at least no bindings that feel python-like).<br><br>So I am wondering how Cppyy behaves in this area. <br><br>E.g. how does this play with templates? I will probably still need to define up-front which instantiations I need to be available in python?<br><br>How does it deal with object ownership? E.g. what happens if the C++ code decides to delete an object that python still points to? Or how are shared pointers dealt with?<br><br>How is type mapping handled? E.g. you might want to call functions taking MyString with "standard" python strings instead of having to construct MyString() objects first and then passing those.</p></body></html>

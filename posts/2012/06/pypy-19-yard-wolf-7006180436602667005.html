<html><body><p>We're pleased to announce the 1.9 release of PyPy. This release brings mostly<br>
bugfixes, performance improvements, other small improvements and overall<br>
progress on the <a class="reference external" href="http://pypy.org/numpydonate.html">numpypy</a> effort.<br>
It also brings an improved situation on Windows and OS X.</p><p>You can download the PyPy 1.9 release here:</p><blockquote><a class="reference external" href="http://pypy.org/download.html">http://pypy.org/download.html</a></blockquote><div class="section" id="what-is-pypy"><h3>What is PyPy?</h3><p>PyPy is a very compliant Python interpreter, almost a drop-in replacement for<br>
CPython 2.7. It's fast (<a class="reference external" href="http://speed.pypy.org">pypy 1.9 and cpython 2.7.2</a> performance comparison)<br>
due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.</p><p>This release supports x86 machines running Linux 32/64, Mac OS X 64 or<br>
Windows 32.  Windows 64 work is still stalling, we would welcome a volunteer<br>
to handle that.</p></div><div class="section" id="thanks-to-our-donors"><h3>Thanks to our donors</h3><p>But first of all, we would like to say thank you to all people who<br>
donated some money to one of our four calls:</p><blockquote><ul class="simple"><li><a class="reference external" href="http://pypy.org/numpydonate.html">NumPy in PyPy</a> (got so far $44502 out of $60000, 74%)</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://pypy.org/py3donate.html">Py3k (Python 3)</a> (got so far $43563 out of $105000, 41%)</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://pypy.org/tmdonate.html">Software Transactional Memory</a> (got so far $21791 of $50400, 43%)</li>
<li>as well as our general PyPy pot.</li>
</ul></blockquote><p>Thank you all for proving that it is indeed possible for a small team of<br>
programmers to get funded like that, at least for some<br>
time.  We want to include this thank you in the present release<br>
announcement even though most of the work is not finished yet.  More<br>
precisely, neither Py3k nor STM are ready to make it in an official release<br>
yet: people interested in them need to grab and (attempt to) translate<br>
PyPy from the corresponding branches (respectively <tt class="docutils literal">py3k</tt> and<br>
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stm-thread</span></tt>).</p></div><div class="section" id="highlights"><h3>Highlights</h3><ul class="simple"><li>This release still implements Python 2.7.2.</li>
<li>Many bugs were corrected for Windows 32 bit.  This includes new<br>
functionality to test the validity of file descriptors; and<br>
correct handling of the calling convensions for ctypes.  (Still not<br>
much progress on Win64.) A lot of work on this has been done by Matti Picus<br>
and Amaury Forgeot d'Arc.</li>
<li>Improvements in <tt class="docutils literal">cpyext</tt>, our emulator for CPython C extension modules.<br>
For example PyOpenSSL should now work.  We thank various people for help.</li>
<li>Sets now have strategies just like dictionaries. This means for example<br>
that a set containing only ints will be more compact (and faster).</li>
<li>A lot of progress on various aspects of <tt class="docutils literal">numpypy</tt>. See the <a class="reference external" href="http://buildbot.pypy.org/numpy-status/latest.html">numpy-status</a><br>
page for the automatic report.</li>
<li>It is now possible to create and manipulate C-like structures using the<br>
PyPy-only <tt class="docutils literal">_ffi</tt> module.  The advantage over using e.g. <tt class="docutils literal">ctypes</tt> is that<br>
<tt class="docutils literal">_ffi</tt> is very JIT-friendly, and getting/setting of fields is translated<br>
to few assembler instructions by the JIT. However, this is mostly intended<br>
as a low-level backend to be used by more user-friendly FFI packages, and<br>
the API might change in the future. Use it at your own risk.</li>
<li>The non-x86 backends for the JIT are progressing but are still not<br>
merged (ARMv7 and PPC64).</li>
<li>JIT hooks for inspecting the created assembler code have been improved.<br>
See <a class="reference external" href="http://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/jit-hooks.html">JIT hooks documentation</a> for details.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">select.kqueue</tt> has been added (BSD).</li>
<li>Handling of keyword arguments has been drastically improved in the best-case<br>
scenario: proxy functions which simply forwards <tt class="docutils literal">*args</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">**kwargs</tt><br>
to another function now performs much better with the JIT.</li>
<li>List comprehension has been improved.</li>

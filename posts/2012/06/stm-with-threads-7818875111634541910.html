<html><body><p>Hi all,</p><p>A quick update.  The first version of pypy-stm <a class="reference" href="http://morepypy.blogspot.ch/2012/05/stm-update-back-to-threads.html">based on regular<br>
threads</a> is ready.  Still having no JIT and a 4-or-5-times performance<br>
hit, it is not particularly fast, but I am happy that it turns out not<br>
to be much slower than the previous thread-less attempts.  It is at<br>
least fast enough to run faster (in real time) than an equivalent no-STM<br>
PyPy, if fed with an eight-threaded program on an eight-core machine<br>
(provided, of course, you don't mind it eating all 8 cores' CPU power<br>
instead of just one :-).</p><p>You can download and play around with <a class="reference" href="http://cobra.cs.uni-duesseldorf.de/~buildmaster/misc/pypy-stm-38eb1fbc3c8d.bz2">this binary</a> for Linux 64.  It<br>
was made from the <a class="reference" href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/src/stm-thread">stm-thread</a> branch of the PyPy repository (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">translate.py --stm -O2 targetpypystandalone.py</span></tt>).  (Be sure<br>
to put it where it can find its stdlib, e.g. by putting it inside the<br>
directory from the official <a class="reference" href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/downloads/pypy-1.9-linux64.tar.bz2">1.9 release</a>.)</p><p>This binary supports the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">thread</span></tt> module and runs without the GIL.<br>
So, despite the factor-of-4 slow-down issue, it should be the <em>fourth</em><br>
complete Python interpreter in which we can reasonably claim to have<br>
resolved the problem of the GIL.  (The first one was Greg Stein's Python<br>
1.4, re-explored <a class="reference" href="http://dabeaz.blogspot.ch/2011/08/inside-look-at-gil-removal-patch-of.html">here</a>; the second one is <a class="reference" href="http://jython.org/">Jython</a>; the third one is<br>
<a class="reference" href="http://ironpython.net/">IronPython</a>.)  Unlike the previous three, it is also the first one to<br>
offer full GIL semantics to the programmer, and additionally<br>
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">thread.atomic</span></tt> (see below).  I should also add that we're likely to<br>
see in the next year a 5th such interpreter, too, based on Hardware<br>
Transactional Memory (same approach as with STM, but using e.g.<br>
<a class="reference" href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2012/02/07/transactional-synchronization-in-haswell/">Intel's HTM</a>).</p><p>The binary I linked to above supports all built-in modules from PyPy,<br>
apart from <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">signal</span></tt>, still being worked on (which can be a bit<br>
annoying because standard library modules like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">subprocess</span></tt> depend on<br>
it).  The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sys.get/setcheckinterval()</span></tt> functions can be used to tweak<br>
the frequency of the automatic commits.  Additionally, it offers<br>
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">thread.atomic</span></tt>, described in the <a class="reference" href="http://morepypy.blogspot.ch/2012/05/stm-update-back-to-threads.html">previous blog post</a> as a way to<br>
create longer atomic sections (with the observable effect of preventing<br>
the "GIL" to be released during that time).  A complete<br>
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">transaction.py</span></tt> module based on it is available <a class="reference" href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/src/stm-thread/lib_pypy/transaction.py">from the sources</a>.</p><p>The main missing features are:</p><ul class="simple"><li>the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">signal</span></tt> module;</li>
<li>the Garbage Collector, which does not do major collections so far, only<br>
minor ones;</li>
<li>and finally, the JIT, which needs some amount of integration to generate<br>
the correctly-tweaked assembler.</li>
</ul><p>Have fun!</p><p>Armin.</p></body></html>

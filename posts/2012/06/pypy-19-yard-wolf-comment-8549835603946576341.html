<html><body><p>Hi Dmitrey, nice to hear from you.<br><br>The page is automatically generated - we should probably just disable those functions, I can't remember the exact reason why they're there in the first place.<br><br>When it comes to missing arguments - you just can't help it. It's an automatically generated page that should give only an overview.<br><br>As far as your patches go - yes, we need tests and we also need tests that cover corner cases. This is very important for us, we can live without the rest (like implementations on the interp-level). We do care about quality a lot.<br><br>Cheers,<br>fijal</p></body></html>

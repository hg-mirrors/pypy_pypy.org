<html><body><p>Thanks for this excellent post; any chance you'll make it to Scipy'2012 in Austin?  I still remember your talk at one of the very old Scipys at Caltech as one of the best we've had; it would be great to catch up on the implications of your continued work on this front since.  With the recent progress on cython and numpy/numba, fresh ideas on the C++ front are a great complement.</p></body></html>

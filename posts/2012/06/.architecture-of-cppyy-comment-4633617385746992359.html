<html><body><p>@Fernando: no, no travel for me anytime soon. If Py4Science is still going, though, I can always walk down the hill, of course. :)<br><br>I've seen Numba (Stefan brought it up on the pypy-dev list), but it appears to be focused on C. With LLVM, we are using the AST directly. I don't think you can drive C++ through llvm-py.<br><br>@Sebastien: the "details" that you are missing are in that "pretty much any" is not the same as "all." Worse, Reflex has a whole toolchain of gccxml, genreflex, C++ compiler, and finally the Reflex API. You lose information at every step along the way. It's one more reason for CLang/LLVM, but as said, that's for Q3/2012.<br><br>Note though that there are two kinds of C headers that one may encounter. Those that are in a pure C environment, and those for mixed C/C++ use (e.g. Python.h and the system headers). In the former case, no-one would drag in the dependency on a C++ compiler, just to use Reflex. Using e.g. CFFI is  a much better option. In the other case, there is no problem either way.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Wim</p></body></html>

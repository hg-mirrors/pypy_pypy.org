<html><body><p>@Arne: here is an example using directly thread.atomic.  In your multithreaded application, at some point, you want to remove an item from list1 and add it to list2, knowing that list1 and list2 are also accessed by other threads.  Then you write:<br><br>with thread.atomic:<br>    x = list1.pop()<br>    list2.append(x)<br><br>This is a classical STM example.  What I'm pushing for is not that, though: it is for not writing multithreaded code in the first place.  With the proper library code you can write code like the first few lines of <a href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/tree/branch//stm-gc/lib_pypy/transaction.py" rel="nofollow">transaction</a>.  The library code would itself use thread.atomic, but not you directly.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>@Benjamin: no, that's not reasonable at all in the context of large transactions.  "Help remind folks to keep their transactions small" is precisely what I don't want: I want <i>large</i> transactions.  This might be harder to do efficiently, it might be more conflict-prone, etc.; but what I <i>don't</i> want is the classical situation where you have to be very careful about keeping your transactions as small as possible, because that's just as hard and error-prone as using locks.<br><br>What I want is for "the average programmer" to not use the "thread" module at all, including "thread.atomic".  This should be part of a library that does thread pooling and dispatching (large) transactions.</p></body></html>

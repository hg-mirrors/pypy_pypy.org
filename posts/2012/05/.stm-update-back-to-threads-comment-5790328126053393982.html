<html><body><p>To expand slightly on what someone else commented, there was <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/LMAX" rel="nofollow">a talk</a> not too long ago by some guys who found out using queues to communicate between threads can be pretty hefty bottleneck. They were using the JVM.<br><br>The talk is interesting because they actually measured the stuff they do and compared it with how it affects the CPU pipelines/caches. The queue discussion is around 32 minutes into the talk.<br><br>It's perhaps not relevant for pypy-stm at the moment, but it's definitely relevant for anyone interested in high-performance multithreaded code.</p></body></html>

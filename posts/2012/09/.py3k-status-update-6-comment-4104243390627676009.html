<html><body><p>I know this might be an odd request but...  Has the pypy team ever considered inquiring Mozilla about embedding pypy into their browser?  I say this because Google is embedding a vm from chromium to support dart.  I do not think this is ideal for an open web.  Pypy, on the other hand, would be ideal as an open web vm!  Think about it!</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>@arne: you can just use the usual translate.py command inside the py3k branch.<br>Or download one of the nightly builds:<br>http://buildbot.pypy.org/nightly/py3k/<br><br>however, note that:<br>- JIT is not enabled (yet)<br>- no focus has been put on performances (yet :)) so it is probably slower than even the non-jitted python2</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>@daniel<i>@Armin, CSP may be built into Go, but IMO this was a mistake, there is no requirement for it to be a language feature; it fits nicer as library. See [python-csp] for a python library </i><br><br>I have looked at Python-CSP a long time ago. I recall it being verbose. However I use Stackless Python. And using PyPy's stackless.py, I implemented select() and join patterns. Sometimes I wish I had language support: they cut down on silly mistakes and make the code less verbose for simple cases. However what I have found is that the language can get in the way. For instance, in Go, one has to come up with hacks to do some simple like do a select on an arbitrary number of channels. Perhaps I am wrong but I suspect stuff like select()'s design was influenced by the fact Newsqueak was originally designed to make a windowing system easier to write. So one is monitoring only a handful of channels. In constrast, this is not the way Stackless Python programmes are written.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Andrew</p></body></html>

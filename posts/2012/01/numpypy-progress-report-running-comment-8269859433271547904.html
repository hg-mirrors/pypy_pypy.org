<html><body><p>This is excellent!  Great work, the potential of this project is very exciting.  I was quietly wishing for this since pypy first started.<br><br>I use NumPy all the time, and any increase in performance makes a big difference.  This is one of the main advantages of NumPyPy over NumPy, so it makes sense to focus on it.<br><br>There seems to be lots of complaining about missing features and such, but having a solid foundation to work from seems to be the most important thing.  Missing features can be added down the line.<br><br>I remember reading a blog post last year about using transactional memory as a way of removing the GIL.  If you could combine that with NumPyPy to run numerical tasks in parallel, that would make a lot of scientific programmers very happy.  I don't know if this is feasible, but it sure would be nice.<br><br>Keep up the good work.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>Chris, if you haven't considered this already, it's sometimes possible to achieve parallelism with multiple processes using memory mapped files as numpy arrays. It's a bit awkward, but it can also make for an easier path to a computation that is resumable or can be run on a cluster.<br><br>GIL removal would be wonderful, but it's a pretty ambitious idea. Then again, these pypy folk seem able to deliver on some pretty amazing stuff.</p></body></html>

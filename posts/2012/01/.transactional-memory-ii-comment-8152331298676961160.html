<html><body><p>One major use-case for multithreading involves a large, unchanging data structure which many threads access. I.e., the data structure is loaded by a parent task, then not modified again; a number of threads are then spawned to use it for calculations.<br><br>In CPython, the GIL makes this impossible if only because the reference counters need to be protected. With Cython in threads, however, you can turn off the GIL and do some work on C-style data structures.<br><br>I'm wondering whether the STM PyPy effort could have a very useful, and very early, benefit: simply enabling an unchanging data structure to be accessed by a number of processors via the kinds of events you describe. There wouldn't be a need for transactions, because the programmer would take responsibility for only sharing unchanging structures between simultaneously-executing events. <br><br>But it seems like the basic requirements for this kind of facility might be met in in early stage of STM development. And a solution that allowed multiple processors to access large, unchanging structures would be very useful in certain applications. I know I have one in mind that I'm looking at CPython/Cython for, but I'd rather see if I could get the performance I need from PyPy.<br><br>Just thought it was worth mentioning.</p></body></html>

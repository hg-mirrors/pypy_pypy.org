<html><body><p>@Armin: That transaction code looks very simple.  It seems trivial to implement a map/mapReduce style function on top of your transaction module.<br><br>It is a very similar API to worker pool APIs which many thread using programs use.  The main difference is that you combine the join() in the run method.  It seems that a threaded web server for example could use this?  What would happen if each incoming request comes in, and is put into the transaction (and say the 10th request has an error)?  Would it be better to use multiple transactions?<br><br>Have you thought how thread local storage would work?</p></body></html>

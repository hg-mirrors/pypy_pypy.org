<html><body><p>I'm new to python but not to Cpython/numpy/scipy/matplotlib and I fail to understand what you are doing.<br><br>* In a nutshell, what's numpypy? Is it a rewrite of the numpy code to make it compatible with pypy? or are you working on pypy itself to be able to run numpy as it is??<br><br>* if numpypy is a rewrite of numpy, that's good but how do you plan to keep numpy and numpypy sync (in terms of functionalities)??<br><br>* Using numpy with pypy will be great but what about scipy qnd matplotlib??<br>Many users need at least these two modules on top of numpy;<br><br>I would be very happy with pypy being able to work with unpachted numpy/scipy/matplotlib.<br><br>I think your website should summarise these issues on its front page.</p></body></html>

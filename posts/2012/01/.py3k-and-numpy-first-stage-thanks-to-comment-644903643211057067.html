<html><body><p>@GaÃ«tan: The reason is simple: I already have a regular day job, 40 hours a week, and I cannot have another remuneration without consent of my employer.<br><br>Actually I started the py3k branch before the funding proposal, and even before that I've been trying different ways to do the transition from str to unicode.<br>Then, my understanding of the JIT and other optimizations is very poor. And there are important changes to do around the representation of unicode for example, or the int/long unification, if we want pypy3k to be as fast as 2.7.<br><br>I am quite happy of the current state: some people are paid to do and finish the real job, and volunteers can have fun and help in some parts, working on the most interesting project around Python.</p></body></html>

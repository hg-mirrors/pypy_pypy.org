<html><body><p>@Anonymous: in the extract you cite I meant "the two main models in Python".  As far as I can tell, Go does concurrency by enforcing all communications to go via channels, so I would classify it as a "special-made" language.  This solution might be nice and usable, but it does not really work at all in languages like Python.</p></body></html>

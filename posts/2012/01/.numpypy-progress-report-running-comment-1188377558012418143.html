<html><body><p>Nice to hear, but what we (numpy users) really need is  2-dimensional matrices with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, /, *, sin, cos, pow etc) and other related methods, e.g. min(array,axis), nanmax(array, axis), argmax(array,axis), nanargmin(array, axis) etc. While CPython soft dependent on these operations works more or less fast, with PyPy it mere doesn't work at all. I hope first of all you'll focus on it instead of speed improvement for single-dimensional arrays.<br>Regards, D.</p></body></html>

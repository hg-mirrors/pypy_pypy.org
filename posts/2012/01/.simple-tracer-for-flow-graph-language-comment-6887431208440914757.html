<html><body><p>@larsr: thanks!<br><br>Yes, in principle you are right that there could be a mechanism that stars to trace from the point where a guard fails. This is an element of tracing JITs that the current code leaves off, it would need to be solved together with the caching of traces.<br><br>A lot of things are just sketched in this implementation, e.g. only one trace ever is started, once you end up in the interpreter the tracer never starts again.</p></body></html>

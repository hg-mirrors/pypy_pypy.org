<html><body><p>@Gary Robinson: (off-topic:) for this kind of use case, you can use os.fork() after the immutable data is ready.  It "kind of works" both in pypy and in cpython, although not really --- in cpython the reference counts are modified, causing the pages to get unshared between processes; and in pypy the garbage collector (GC) has the same effect, so far.  It could be solved in pypy by more tweaks the GC.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>The next PyPy sprint will be held --- for the first time in a while ---
in a place where we haven't been so far: Leipzig, Germany, at the
<a class="reference" href="http://www.python-academy.com/">Python Academy</a>'s Teaching Center.  It will take place from the 22nd
to the 27th of June 2012, before EuroPython.  Thanks to Mike MÃ¼ller for
organizing it!</p>
<p>This is a fully public sprint, everyone is welcome to join us.  All days are
full sprint days, so it is recommended to arrive the 21st and leave the 28th.</p>
<h3>Topics and goals</h3>
<p>Open.  Here are some goals:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>numpy: progress towards completing the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">numpypy</span></tt> module; try to
use it in real code</li>
<li>stm: progress on Transactional Memory; try out the <tt class="docutils literal"><a href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/tree/branch/stm-gc/lib_pypy/transaction.py"><span class="pre">transaction</span></a></tt> module on real code.</li>
<li>jit optimizations: there are a number of optimizations we can still
try out or refactor.</li>
<li>work on various, more efficient data structures for Python language.
A good example would be lazy string slicing/concatenation or more efficient
objects.</li>
<li>any other PyPy-related topic is fine too.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Grants</h3>
<p>For students, we have the possibility to support some costs via PyPy
funds.  Additionally, we can support you applying for grants from the
PSF and other sources.</p>

<html><body><p>@arne: right, maybe.  It points to a similarity, at least.  This simple example corresponds nicely to map(), but in other examples (like richards) we add() more transactions from within transactions.  Nevertheless, using the "with ... as t:" syntax might work, by passing the "t" inside transactions in order to call t.map() or t.add() on it too.<br><br>This would also open the door to naturally nest these constructs.  Right now if you call transaction.run() inside a transaction, you get an error.  Such a case is more work to support in the current implementation, but from the surface it looks like a transaction.Runner() kind of interface should allow us to express what we need.</p></body></html>

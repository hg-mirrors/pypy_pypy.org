<html><body><p>Hello.</p>
<p>A lot of things happened in March, like <a class="reference external" href="http://us.pycon.org">pycon</a>. I was also busy doing other
things (pictured), so apologies for the late numpy status update.</p>
<p>However, a lot of things have happened and numpy continues to be one of the
main points of entry for hacking on PyPy. Apologies to all the people whose
patches I don't review in timely manner, but seriously, you do <strong>a lot</strong> of
work.</p>
<p>This list of changes is definitely not exhaustive, and I might be forgetting
important contributions. In a loose order:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Matti Picus made <tt class="docutils literal">out</tt> parameter work for a lot of (but not all)
functions.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">We merged record dtypes support. The only missing dtypes left are complex
(important), datetime (less important) and object (which will probably
never be implemented because it makes very little sense and is a mess with moving GCs).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Taavi Burns and others implemented lots of details, including lots of ufuncs.
On the completely unscientific measure of "implemented functions" on
<a class="reference external" href="http://buildbot.pypy.org/numpy-status/latest.html">numpypy status page</a>, we're close to 50% of numpy working. In reality
it might be more or less, but after complex dtypes we're getting very close
to running real programs.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Bool indexing of arrays of the same size should work, leaving only
arrays-of-ints indexing as the last missing element of fancy indexing.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">I did some very early experiments on SSE. This work is <strong>seriously</strong>
preliminary - in fact the only implemented operation is addition of
float single-dimension numpy arrays. However, results are encouraging,
given that our assembler generator is far from ideal:</p>

<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/fijal/hack2/src/fa3119d8ade6/bench/numeric">benchmark repo</a> is available. GCC was run with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-O3</span></tt>, no further
options specified. PyPy was run with default options, the SSE branch is under
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">backend-vector-ops</span></tt>, but <strong>it's not working completely</strong> yet.</p>
<p>One might argue that C and Python is not the same code - indeed it is not.
It just shows some possible approach to writing numeric code.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Next step would be to just continue implementing missing features such as</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>specialised arrays i.e. masked arrays and matrixes</li>
<li>core modules such as <tt class="docutils literal">fft</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">linalg</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">random</tt>.</li>
<li>numpy's testing framework</li>
</ul>
<p>The future is hard to predict, but we're not far off!</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>fijal</p>

<p><b>UPDATE:</b>Indeed, string and unicode dtypes are not supported yet. They're as important as complex dtype</p></body></html>

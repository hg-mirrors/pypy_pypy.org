<html><body><p>Support for objects is actually quite useful: please reconsider adding it.<br><br>Here is a very useful case: the manipulation of arrays of numbers with uncertainties (special uncertainties.UFloat objects). Numbers with uncertainties behave very much like regular numbers: it is very useful to be able to use the regular NumPy syntax for array operations, for calculating matrix inverses when the matrices contain number with uncertainties, etc. I know many people use these features.<br><br>It would be *great* (read: irreplaceable :) to have support for the object NumPy dtype.</p></body></html>

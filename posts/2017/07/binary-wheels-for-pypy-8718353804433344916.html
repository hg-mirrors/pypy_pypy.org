<html><body><p>Hi,<br>
<br>
this is a short blog post, just to announce the existence of this <a href="https://github.com/antocuni/pypy-wheels" target="_blank">Github repository</a>, which contains binary PyPy wheels for some selected packages. The availability of binary wheels means that you can install the packages much more quickly, without having to wait for compilation.<br>
</p><div>
<br></div>
At the moment of writing, these packages are available:<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>numpy</li>
<li>scipy</li>
<li>pandas</li>
<li>psutil</li>
<li>netifaces</li>
</ul>
<br>
For now, we provide only wheels built on Ubuntu, compiled for PyPy 5.8.<br>
In particular, it is worth noting that they are <b>not</b>Â <span>manylinux1</span> wheels, which means they could not work on other Linux distributions. For more information, see the explanation in the README of the above repo.<br>
<br>
Moreover, the existence of the wheels does not guarantee that they work correctly 100% of the time. they still depend on <span>cpyext</span>, our C-API emulation layer, which is still work-in-progress, although it has become better and better during the last months. Again, the wheels are there only to save compilation time.<br>
<br>
To install a package from the wheel repository, you can invoke <span>pip</span> like this:<br>
<br>
<span>$ pip install --extra-index https://antocuni.github.io/pypy-wheels/ubuntu numpy</span><br>

Happy installing!</div></body></html>

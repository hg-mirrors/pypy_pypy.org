<html><body><p>The next PyPy sprint will be in Leysin, Switzerland, for the twelveth time.
This is a fully public sprint: newcomers and topics other than those
proposed below are welcome.</p>
<div class="section" id="goals-and-topics-of-the-sprint">
<h3>Goals and topics of the sprint</h3>
<p>The list of topics is very open.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The main topic is Python 3.5 support in PyPy, as most py3.5
contributors should be present.  It is also a good topic if you have
no or limited experience with PyPy contribution: we can easily find
something semi-independent that is not done in py3.5 so far, and
do pair-programming with you.</li>
<li>Any other topic is fine too: JIT compiler optimizations, CFFI,
the RevDB reverse debugger, improving to speed of your program on
PyPy, etc.</li>
<li>And as usual, the main side goal is to have fun in winter sports :-)
We can take a day off (for ski or anything else).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="exact-times">
<h3>Exact times</h3>
<p>Work days: starting 26th Feb (~noon), ending March 4th (~noon).</p>
<p>I have pre-booked the week from Saturday Feb 25th to Saturday March 4th.
If it is possible for you to arrive Sunday before mid-afternoon, then
you should get a booking from Sunday only.  The break day should be
around Wednesday.</p>
<p>It is fine to stay a few more days on either side, or conversely to book
for a part of that time only.</p>

<h3>Location &amp; Accomodation</h3>

<p>Leysin, Switzerland, "same place as before".</p>

<p>Let me refresh your
memory: both the sprint venue and the lodging will be in a
pair of chalets built specifically for bed &amp; breakfast:
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.ermina.ch/">http://www.ermina.ch/</a>.  The place has a good ADSL Internet connection
with wireless installed.  You can also arrange your own lodging
elsewhere (as long as you are in Leysin, you cannot be more than a 15
minutes walk away from the sprint venue).</p>
<p>Please <em>confirm</em> that you are coming so that we can adjust the
reservations as appropriate.</p>
<p>The options of rooms are a bit more limited than on previous years
because the place for bed-and-breakfast is shrinking; but we should
still have enough room for us.  The price is around 60 CHF, breakfast
included, in shared rooms (3 or 4 people).  If there are people that
would prefer a double or single room, please contact me and we'll see
what choices you have.  There are also a choice of hotels in Leysin.</p>

<p>You need a Swiss-to-(insert country here) power adapter.  There will be
some Swiss-to-EU adapters around, and at least one EU-format power strip.</p>

The PyPy team is proud to release both PyPy2.7 v5.8 (an interpreter supporting
Python 2.7 syntax), and a beta-quality PyPy3.5 v5.8 (an interpreter for Python
3.5 syntax). The two releases are both based on much the same codebase, thus
the dual release.  Note that PyPy3.5 supports Linux 64bit only for now.<br>
<br>
This new PyPy2.7 release includes the upstream stdlib version 2.7.13, and
PyPy3.5 includes the upstream stdlib version 3.5.3.<br>
<br>
We fixed critical bugs in the <a class="reference external" href="http://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/config/translation.gcrootfinder.html">shadowstack</a> rootfinder garbage collector
strategy that crashed multithreaded programs and very rarely showed up
even in single threaded programs.<br>
<br>
We added native PyPy support to profile frames in the <a class="reference external" href="http://vmprof.readthedocs.io/">vmprof</a> statistical
profiler.<br>
<br>
The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">struct</span></code> module functions <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pack*</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">unpack*</span></code> are now much faster,
especially on raw buffers and bytearrays. Microbenchmarks show a 2x to 10x
speedup. Thanks to <a class="reference external" href="http://gambitresearch.com/">Gambit Research</a> for sponsoring this work.<br>
<br>
This release adds (but disables by default) link-time optimization and
<a class="reference external" href="https://pythonfiles.wordpress.com/2017/05/12/enabling-profile-guided-optimizations-for-pypy">profile guided optimization</a> of the base interpreter, which may make
unjitted code run faster. To use these, translate with appropriate
<a class="reference external" href="http://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/config/commandline.html#general-translation-options">options</a>.  Be aware of <a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues/2572/link-time-optimization-lto-disabled">issues with gcc toolchains</a>, though.<br>
<br>
Please let us know if your use case is slow, we have ideas how to make things
faster but need real-world examples (not micro-benchmarks) of problematic code.<br>
<br>
Work sponsored by a Mozilla <a class="reference external" href="https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2016/08/pypy-gets-funding-from-mozilla-for.html">grant</a> continues on PyPy3.5; numerous fixes from
CPython were ported to PyPy and PEP 489 was fully implemented. Of course the
bug fixes and performance enhancements mentioned above are part of both PyPy
2.7 and PyPy 3.5.<br>
<br>
<a class="reference external" href="https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/whatsnew.html">CFFI</a>, which is part of the PyPy release, has been updated to an unreleased 1.10.1,
improving an already great package for interfacing with C.<br>
<br>
Anyone using <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/release.html">NumPy 1.13.0</a>, must upgrade PyPy to this release since we implemented some previously missing C-API functionality. Many other c-extension modules now work with PyPy, let us know if yours does not.<br>
<br>
As always, this release fixed many issues and bugs raised by the
growing community of PyPy users. We strongly recommend updating.<br>

We would like to thank our donors and contributors, and
encourage new people to join the project. PyPy has many
layers and we need help with all of them: <a class="reference external" href="http://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/index.html">PyPy</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.org/">RPython</a> documentation
improvements, tweaking popular <a class="reference external" href="http://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/project-ideas.html#make-more-python-modules-pypy-friendly">modules</a> to run on PyPy, or general <a class="reference external" href="http://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/project-ideas.html">help</a>
with making RPython’s JIT even better.<br>
<br>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">
What is PyPy?</h2>
PyPy is a very compliant Python interpreter, almost a drop-in replacement for CPython 2.7 and CPython 3.5. It’s fast (<a class="reference external" href="http://speed.pypy.org/">PyPy and CPython 2.7.x</a> performance comparison) due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.<br>
We also welcome developers of other <a class="reference external" href="http://rpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html">dynamic languages</a> to see what RPython can do for them.<br>
The PyPy 2.7 release supports:<br>
<blockquote>
<div>
<ul class="simple">
<li><b>x86</b> machines on most common operating systems (Linux 32/64 bits, Mac OS X 64 bits, Windows 32 bits, OpenBSD, FreeBSD)</li>
<li>newer <b>ARM</b> hardware (ARMv6 or ARMv7, with VFPv3) running Linux,</li>
<li>big- and little-endian variants of <b>PPC64</b> running Linux,</li>
<li><b>s390x</b> running Linux </li>
</ul>

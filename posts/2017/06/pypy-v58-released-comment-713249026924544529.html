<html><body><p>Can we get a comprehensive update on Numpypy? It has gone really quiet since the days when Alex Gaynor used to talk at Pycon etc about the work which has been going on since what 2010/11? The repo has issues that are not looked at. I would really like an honest appraisal of what was learned in the Numpypy project and what is the future of Numpy (Scipy too) &amp; PyPy because the situation for developers like myself is that we're caught between a rock and a hard place. PyPy consistently allows us to write code and explore algorithms in Python!! Whereas CPython forces you into C/Cython continually. PyPy is a great dream in my heart. What you guys are doing - allowing me to write Python and it be fast. What other language forces you so much to write in another language when performance is a consideration? The speed difference between Node.js and Python 3 is laughable. PyPy for the win!!!! <br><br>But....and it's a big but I am one of those devs who extensively is addicted to numeric arrays, not because I'm a 'quant' or an astronomer or rocket scientist but because Numpy arrays are simply better for many solutions than Python's other data structures. And once leveraged, giving that up to go to PyPy is impossible. It forces you to choose between numpy + slower python (CPython) or slower Numpy and faster python (PyPy). <br><br>Numpypy was a great dream, the best of both. But it seems to have failed, proven to be too difficult or does it simply need more money? I would appreciate a public update (if one exists, please link to it). Because the sadness for me is that a genuinely fast Python runtime will never be usable until the Numpy/Scipy world works and you get the fast python and as fast numpy. <br><br>I would really like to help, raise money whatever but maybe I'm out of the loop and the plan has changed?</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>Hi Albert. We have decided that a better route is to use upstream NumPy for compatibility. We are a small group, and reimplementing all of the c code in NumPy for Numpypy would be a never ending, close to impossible task.<br><br>However, we do have a different long-term plan to combine numpy and python. Since our c-api emulation layer is slow, perhaps we can "hijack" the most common python calls that cross that emulation border and make <b>them</b> fast. This would utilize much of NumPyPy but would mean that only a subset of the extensive NumPy library would need to be implemented and maintained. We have a branch that demonstrates a proof-of-concept for simple item access (ctypedef struct). Help on the PyPy project is always welcome, come to #pypy on IRC and we can discuss it further.</p></body></html>

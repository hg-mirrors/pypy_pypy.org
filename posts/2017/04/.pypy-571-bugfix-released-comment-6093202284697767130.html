<html><body><p>Tried looking for a pypy wishlist but couldn't find one. So hopefully somebody reads comments.<br><br>My three biggest pypy wishes are for...<br><br>1. faster csv file reading by replacing Python library code with compiled C code which I understand from 4 years ago is still slower than cPython so is still on the todo list.<br><br>2. Update SQLite to latest version in pypy distribution since they have made some great speed enhancements in recent releases.<br><br>3. Create an containerized downloadable Docker distribution for PyPy which allows for easy deployment of PyPy projects to other machines. platforms and thumbs drives. This would also allow easier setup of multiple PyPy microservices and encapsulation of multiple pypy environments on the same machine.<br></p></body></html>

Please report an issue with reproducible examples if you find that PyPy is still a lot slower than CPython at reading large-ish csv files.<br><br>For SQLite, I guess you're talking about Windows.  We have plans to update it at some point.<br><br>For Docker, that's outside the scope of the PyPy team and should be done (or is done already?) by other people.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>@Canesin: benefit for performance?  No.  The PEP itself says "Using type hints for performance optimizations is left as an exercise for the reader".  But that's a misleading comment.  There is no useful optimization that we can apply from the knowledge "argument 1 is an int", because that could also be an arbitrarily-large integer and/or an instance of a subclass of int.  And if it really turns out to be almost always a regular machine-sized integer, then PyPy's JIT will figure it out by itself.   PEP 484 is totally pointless for performance.  (It is probably useful for other reasons outside the scope of this comment.)</p></body></html>

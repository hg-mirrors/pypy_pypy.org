<html><body><p>From what I've read on #pypy (sorry if I'm messing something up): uvloop is a drop-in replacement of asyncio, but asyncio is faster on PyPy.  PyPy's JIT for pure Python code beats the overheads of the CPython API compatibility layer (in this case, via Cython).  Moreover, considering the whole application, using asyncio on PyPy easily beats using uvloop on CPython.  So, as long as it remains a fully compatible replacement, you can "drop it out" and use asyncio instead on PyPy.</p></body></html>

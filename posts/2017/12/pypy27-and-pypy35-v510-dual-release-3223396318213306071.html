<p>The PyPy team is proud to release both PyPy2.7 v5.10 (an interpreter supporting
Python 2.7 syntax), and a final PyPy3.5 v5.10 (an interpreter for Python
3.5 syntax). The two releases are both based on much the same codebase, thus
the dual release.</p>
<p>This release is an incremental release with very few new features, the main
feature being the final PyPy3.5 release that works on linux and OS X with beta
windows support. It also includes fixes for <a class="reference external" href="http://vmprof.readthedocs.io">vmprof</a> cooperation with greenlets.</p>
<p>Compared to 5.9, the 5.10 release contains mostly bugfixes and small improvements.
We have in the pipeline big new features coming for PyPy 6.0 that did not make
the release cut and should be available within the next couple months.</p>
<p>As always, this release is 100% compatible with the previous one and fixed
several issues and bugs raised by the growing community of PyPy users.
As always, we strongly recommend updating.</p>
<p>There are quite a few important changes that are in the pipeline that did not
make it into the 5.10 release. Most important are speed improvements to cpyext
(which will make numpy and pandas a bit faster) and utf8 branch that changes
internal representation of unicode to utf8, which should help especially the
Python 3.5 version of PyPy.</p>
<p>This release concludes the Mozilla Open Source <a class="reference external" href="https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2016/08/pypy-gets-funding-from-mozilla-for.html">grant</a> for having a compatible
PyPy 3.5 release and we're very grateful for that.  Of course, we will continue
to improve PyPy 3.5 and probably move to 3.6 during the course of 2018.</p>

<p>We would like to thank our donors for the continued support of the PyPy
project.</p>
<p>We would also like to thank our contributors and
encourage new people to join the project. PyPy has many
layers and we need help with all of them: <a class="reference external" href="index.html">PyPy</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.org">RPython</a> documentation
improvements, tweaking popular <a class="reference external" href="project-ideas.html#make-more-python-modules-pypy-friendly">modules</a> to run on pypy, or general <a class="reference external" href="project-ideas.html">help</a>
with making RPython's JIT even better.</p>

<h1>What is PyPy?</h1>
<p>PyPy is a very compliant Python interpreter, almost a drop-in replacement for
CPython 2.7 and CPython 3.5. It's fast (<a class="reference external" href="http://speed.pypy.org">PyPy and CPython 2.7.x</a> performance comparison)
due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.</p>
<p>We also welcome developers of other <a class="reference external" href="http://rpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html">dynamic languages</a> to see what RPython
can do for them.</p>
<p>The PyPy release supports:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>x86</strong> machines on most common operating systems
(Linux 32/64 bits, Mac OS X 64 bits, Windows 32 bits, OpenBSD, FreeBSD)</li>
<li>newer <strong>ARM</strong> hardware (ARMv6 or ARMv7, with VFPv3) running Linux,</li>
<li>big- and little-endian variants of <strong>PPC64</strong> running Linux,</li>
<li><strong>s390x</strong> running Linux</li>
</ul>

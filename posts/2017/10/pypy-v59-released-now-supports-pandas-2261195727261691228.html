The PyPy team is proud to release both PyPy3.5 v5.9 (a beta-quality interpreter for Python
3.5 syntax) and PyPy2.7 v5.9 (an interpreter supporting
Python 2.7 syntax). <br>

<br>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>NumPy and Pandas now work on PyPy2.7 (together with Cython 0.27.1). Many other modules
based on C-API extensions work on PyPy as well.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>Cython 0.27.1 (released very recently) supports more projects with PyPy, both
on PyPy2.7 and PyPy3.5 beta. Note version <strong>0.27.1</strong> is now the minimum
version that supports this version of PyPy, due to some interactions with
updated C-API interface code.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>We optimized the JSON parser for recurring string keys, which should decrease
memory use by up to 50% and increase parsing speed by up to 15% for large JSON files
with many repeating dictionary keys (which is quite common).</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/whatsnew.html">CFFI</a>, which is part of the PyPy release, has been updated to 1.11.1,
improving an already great package for interfacing with C. CFFI now supports
complex arguments in API mode, as well as <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">char16_t</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">char32_t</span></code> and has
improved support for callbacks.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>Issues in the C-API compatibility layer that appeared as excessive memory
use were cleared up and other incompatibilities were resolved. The C-API
compatibility layer does slow down code which crosses the python-c interface
often. Some fixes are in the pipelines for some of the performance issues, and we still recommend
using pure python on PyPy or interfacing via <a class="reference external" href="https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/whatsnew.html">CFFI</a>.  </li>
</ul>
<br>
Please let us know if your use case is slow, we have ideas how to make things
faster but need real-world examples (not micro-benchmarks) of problematic code.<br>

<br>
Work sponsored by a Mozilla <a class="reference external" href="https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2016/08/pypy-gets-funding-from-mozilla-for.html">grant</a> continues on PyPy3.5; we continue on the path to the goal of a complete python 3.5 implementation. Of course the bug fixes and performance enhancements
mentioned above are part of both PyPy2.7 and PyPy3.5 beta.<br>

<br>
As always, this release fixed many other issues and bugs raised by the
growing community of PyPy users. We strongly recommend updating.<br>

<br>
You can download the v5.9 releases here (note that we provide PyPy3.5 binaries for only Linux 64bit for now):<br>

We would like to thank our donors and contributors, and
encourage new people to join the project. PyPy has many
layers and we need help with all of them: <a class="reference external" href="http://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/index.html">PyPy</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.org/">RPython</a> documentation
improvements, tweaking popular <a class="reference external" href="http://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/project-ideas.html#make-more-python-modules-pypy-friendly">modules</a> to run on PyPy, or general <a class="reference external" href="http://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/project-ideas.html">help</a>
with making RPython’s JIT even better.<br>
<br>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">
What is PyPy?</h2>
PyPy is a very compliant Python interpreter, almost a drop-in replacement for CPython 2.7 (stdlib version 2.7.13), and CPython 3.5 (stdlib version 3.5.3). It’s fast (<a class="reference external" href="http://speed.pypy.org/">PyPy and CPython 2.7.x</a> performance comparison) due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.<br>
<br>
We also welcome developers of other <a class="reference external" href="http://rpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html">dynamic languages</a> to see what RPython can do for them.<br>
<br>
The PyPy 2.7 release supports:<br>
<blockquote>
<div>
<ul class="simple">
<li><b>x86</b> machines on most common operating systems (Linux 32/64 bits, Mac OS X 64 bits, Windows 32 bits, OpenBSD, FreeBSD)</li>
<li>newer <b>ARM</b> hardware (ARMv6 or ARMv7, with VFPv3) running Linux,</li>
<li>big- and little-endian variants of <b>PPC64</b> running Linux,</li>
<li><b>s390x</b> running Linux </li>
</ul>
</div>

What else is new?</h2>
<div style="text-align: left;">
PyPy 5.8 was released in June, 2017.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
There are many incremental improvements to RPython and PyPy, the complete listing is <a href="http://pypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/release-v5.9.0.html">here</a>.</div>

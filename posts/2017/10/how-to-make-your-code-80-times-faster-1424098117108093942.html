I often hear people who are happy because PyPy makes their code 2 times faster
or so. Here is a short personal story which shows PyPy can go well beyond
that.<br>
<br>
<strong>DISCLAIMER</strong>: this is not a silver bullet or a general recipe: it worked in
this particular case, it might not work so well in other cases. But I think it
is still an interesting technique. Moreover, the various steps and
implementations are showed in the same order as I tried them during the
development, so it is a real-life example of how to proceed when optimizing
for PyPy.<br>
<br>
Some months ago I <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/antocuni/evolvingcopter">played a bit</a> with evolutionary algorithms: the ambitious
plan was to automatically evolve a logic which could control a (simulated)
quadcopter, i.e. a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller">PID controller</a> (<strong>spoiler</strong>: it doesn't fly).<br>
<br>
The idea is to have an initial population of random creatures: at each
generation, the ones with the best fitness survive and reproduce with small,
random variations.<br>
<br>
However, for the scope of this post, the actual task at hand is not so
important, so let's jump straight to the code. To drive the quadcopter, a
<tt class="docutils literal">Creature</tt> has a <tt class="docutils literal">run_step</tt> method which runs at each <tt class="docutils literal">delta_t</tt> (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/antocuni/evolvingcopter/blob/master/ev/creature.py">full
code</a>):<br>

<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">inputs</tt> is a numpy array containing the desired setpoint and the current
position on the Z axis;</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">outputs</tt> is a numpy array containing the thrust to give to the motors. To
start easy, all the 4 motors are constrained to have the same thrust, so
that the quadcopter only travels up and down the Z axis;</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">self.state</tt> contains arbitrary values of unknown size which are passed from
one step to the next;</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">self.matrix</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">self.constant</tt> contains the actual logic. By putting
the "right" values there, in theory we could get a perfectly tuned PID
controller. These are randomly mutated between generations.</li>
</ul>
<tt class="docutils literal">run_step</tt> is called at 100Hz (in the virtual time frame of the simulation). At each
generation, we test 500 creatures for a total of 12 virtual seconds each. So,
we have a total of 600,000 executions of <tt class="docutils literal">run_step</tt> at each generation.<br>
<br>
At first, I simply tried to run this code on CPython; here is the result:<br>
<pre class="code literal-block">$ python -m ev.main
Generation   1: ... [population = 500]  [12.06 secs]
Generation   2: ... [population = 500]  [6.13 secs]
Generation   3: ... [population = 500]  [6.11 secs]
Generation   4: ... [population = 500]  [6.09 secs]
Generation   5: ... [population = 500]  [6.18 secs]
Generation   6: ... [population = 500]  [6.26 secs]
</pre>
Which means ~6.15 seconds/generation, excluding the first.<br>
<br>
Then I tried with PyPy 5.9:<br>
<pre class="code literal-block">$ pypy -m ev.main
Generation   1: ... [population = 500]  [63.90 secs]
Generation   2: ... [population = 500]  [33.92 secs]
Generation   3: ... [population = 500]  [34.21 secs]
Generation   4: ... [population = 500]  [33.75 secs]
</pre>
Ouch! We are ~5.5x slower than CPython. This was kind of expected: numpy is
based on cpyext, which is infamously slow.  (Actually, <a class="reference external" href="https://morepypy.blogspot.it/2017/10/cape-of-good-hope-for-pypy-hello-from.html">we are working on
that</a> and on the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cpyext-avoid-roundtrip</span></tt> branch we are already faster than
CPython, but this will be the subject of another blog post.)<br>
<br>
So, let's try to avoid cpyext. The first obvious step is to use <a class="reference external" href="http://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/faq.html#what-about-numpy-numpypy-micronumpy">numpypy</a>
instead of numpy (actually, there is a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/antocuni/evolvingcopter/blob/master/ev/pypycompat.py">hack</a> to use just the micronumpy
part). Let's see if the speed improves:<br>
<pre class="code literal-block">$ pypy -m ev.main   # using numpypy
Generation   1: ... [population = 500]  [5.60 secs]
Generation   2: ... [population = 500]  [2.90 secs]
Generation   3: ... [population = 500]  [2.78 secs]
Generation   4: ... [population = 500]  [2.69 secs]
Generation   5: ... [population = 500]  [2.72 secs]
Generation   6: ... [population = 500]  [2.73 secs]
</pre>
So, ~2.7 seconds on average: this is 12x faster than PyPy+numpy, and more than
2x faster than the original CPython. At this point, most people would be happy
and go tweeting how PyPy is great.<br>
<br>
In general, when talking of CPython vs PyPy, I am rarely satified of a 2x
speedup: I know that PyPy can do much better than this, especially if you
write code which is specifically optimized for the JIT. For a real-life
example, have a look at <a class="reference external" href="http://capnpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/benchmarks.html">capnpy benchmarks</a>, in which the PyPy version is
~15x faster than the heavily optimized CPython+Cython version (both have been
written by me, and I tried hard to write the fastest code for both
implementations).<br>
<br>
So, let's try to do better. As usual, the first thing to do is to profile and
see where we spend most of the time. Here is the <a class="reference external" href="http://vmprof.com/#/449ca8ee-3ab2-49d4-b6f0-9099987e9000">vmprof profile</a>. We spend a
lot of time inside the internals of numpypy, and allocating tons of temporary
arrays to store the results of the various operations.<br>
<br>
Also, let's look at the <a class="reference external" href="http://vmprof.com/#/28fd6e8f-f103-4bf4-a76a-4b65dbd637f4/traces">jit traces</a> and search for the function <tt class="docutils literal">run</tt>:
this is loop in which we spend most of the time, and it is composed of 1796
operations.  The operations emitted for the line <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">np.dot(...)</span> +
self.constant</tt> are listed between lines 1217 and 1456. Here is the excerpt
which calls <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">np.dot(...)</span></tt>; most of the ops are cheap, but at line 1232 we
see a call to the RPython function <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/src/89d1f31fabc86778cfaa1034b1102887c063de66/pypy/module/micronumpy/ndarray.py?at=default&amp;fileviewer=file-view-default#ndarray.py-1168">descr_dot</a>; by looking at the
implementation we see that it creates a new <tt class="docutils literal">W_NDimArray</tt> to store the
result, which means it has to do a <tt class="docutils literal">malloc()</tt>:<br>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_h6BuLTtEO8/Wfb6BXDg93I/AAAAAAAABNY/BY2XBg4ZtwokB9f1mWSmzI9gn_qanb81QCLcBGAs/s1600/2017-10-trace1.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="450" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_h6BuLTtEO8/Wfb6BXDg93I/AAAAAAAABNY/BY2XBg4ZtwokB9f1mWSmzI9gn_qanb81QCLcBGAs/s640/2017-10-trace1.png" width="640"></a></div>
<br>
The implementation of the <tt class="docutils literal">+ self.constant</tt> part is also interesting:
contrary the former, the call to <tt class="docutils literal">W_NDimArray.descr_add</tt> has been inlined by
the JIT, so we have a better picture of what's happening; in particular, we
can see the call to <tt class="docutils literal">__0_alloc_with_del____</tt> which allocates the
<tt class="docutils literal">W_NDimArray</tt> for the result, and the <tt class="docutils literal">raw_malloc</tt> which allocates the
actual array. Then we have a long list of 149 simple operations which set the
fields of the resulting array, construct an iterator, and finally do a
<tt class="docutils literal">call_assembler</tt>: this is the actual logic to do the addition, which was
JITtted indipendently; <tt class="docutils literal">call_assembler</tt> is one of the operations to do
JIT-to-JIT calls:<br>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vmo0pWharIU/Wfb3VfwHjxI/AAAAAAAABNE/a6Em09qZizwGiWJeTbGzKfHQH70dB7RKgCEwYBhgL/s1600/2017-10-trace2.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="640" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vmo0pWharIU/Wfb3VfwHjxI/AAAAAAAABNE/a6Em09qZizwGiWJeTbGzKfHQH70dB7RKgCEwYBhgL/s640/2017-10-trace2.png" width="625"></a></div>
<br>
All of this is very suboptimal: in this particular case, we know that the
shape of <tt class="docutils literal">self.matrix</tt> is always <tt class="docutils literal">(3, 2)</tt>: so, we are doing an incredible
amount of work, including calling <tt class="docutils literal">malloc()</tt> twice for the temporary arrays, just to
call two functions which ultimately do a total of 6 multiplications
and 6 additions.  Note also that this is not a fault of the JIT: CPython+numpy
has to do the same amount of work, just hidden inside C calls.<br>
<br>
One possible solution to this nonsense is a well known compiler optimization:
loop unrolling.  From the compiler point of view, unrolling the loop is always
risky because if the matrix is too big you might end up emitting a huge blob
of code, possibly uselss if the shape of the matrices change frequently: this
is the main reason why the PyPy JIT does not even try to do it in this case.<br>
<br>
However, we <strong>know</strong> that the matrix is small, and always of the same
shape. So, let's unroll the loop manually:<br>

</pre>
In the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/antocuni/evolvingcopter/blob/master/ev/creature.py#L100">actual code</a> there is also a sanity check which asserts that the
computed output is the very same as the one returned by <tt class="docutils literal">Creature.run_step</tt>.<br>
<br>
So, let's try to see how it performs. First, with CPython:<br>
<pre class="code literal-block">$ python -m ev.main
Generation   1: ... [population = 500]  [7.61 secs]
Generation   2: ... [population = 500]  [3.96 secs]
Generation   3: ... [population = 500]  [3.79 secs]
Generation   4: ... [population = 500]  [3.74 secs]
Generation   5: ... [population = 500]  [3.84 secs]
Generation   6: ... [population = 500]  [3.69 secs]
</pre>
This looks good: 60% faster than the original CPython+numpy
implementation. Let's try on PyPy:<br>
<pre class="code literal-block">Generation   1: ... [population = 500]  [0.39 secs]
Generation   2: ... [population = 500]  [0.10 secs]
Generation   3: ... [population = 500]  [0.11 secs]
Generation   4: ... [population = 500]  [0.09 secs]
Generation   5: ... [population = 500]  [0.08 secs]
Generation   6: ... [population = 500]  [0.12 secs]
Generation   7: ... [population = 500]  [0.09 secs]
Generation   8: ... [population = 500]  [0.08 secs]
Generation   9: ... [population = 500]  [0.08 secs]
Generation  10: ... [population = 500]  [0.08 secs]
Generation  11: ... [population = 500]  [0.08 secs]
Generation  12: ... [population = 500]  [0.07 secs]
Generation  13: ... [population = 500]  [0.07 secs]
Generation  14: ... [population = 500]  [0.08 secs]
Generation  15: ... [population = 500]  [0.07 secs]
</pre>
Yes, it's not an error. After a couple of generations, it stabilizes at around
~0.07-0.08 seconds per generation. This is around <strong>80 (eighty) times faster</strong>
than the original CPython+numpy implementation, and around 35-40x faster than
the naive PyPy+numpypy one.<br>
<br>
Let's look at the <a class="reference external" href="http://vmprof.com/#/402af746-2966-4403-a61d-93015abac033/traces">trace</a> again: it no longer contains expensive calls, and
certainly no more temporary <tt class="docutils literal">malloc()</tt> s. The core of the logic is between
lines 386-416, where we can see that it does fast C-level multiplications and
additions: <tt class="docutils literal">float_mul</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">float_add</tt> are translated straight into
<tt class="docutils literal">mulsd</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">addsd</tt> x86 instructions.<br>
<br>
As I said before, this is a very particular example, and the techniques
described here do not always apply: it is not realistic to expect an 80x
speedup on arbitrary code, unfortunately. However, it clearly shows the potential of PyPy when
it comes to high-speed computing. And most importantly, it's not a toy
benchmark which was designed specifically to have good performance on PyPy:
it's a real world example, albeit small.<br>

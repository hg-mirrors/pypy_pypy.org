<html><body><p>Really excited to hear about the Unicode representation changes; it should finally make PyPy significantly faster at Unicode manipulation than CPython 3.6 is. It seems this has been bogging down PyPy's advantage at Unicode-heavy workloads like webapp template rendering.<br><br>Even without O(1) access to characters by index, I think it's a great idea to use UTF-8 internally, since that's the prevalent encoding for input/output pretty much everywhere. Accessing Unicode characters by index is an antipattern in most situations and UCS-2/UTF-16 is becoming irrelevant.</p></body></html>

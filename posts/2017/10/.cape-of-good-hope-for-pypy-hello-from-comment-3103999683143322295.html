<html><body><p>Could you give a hint to how you're doing O(1) individual character access in UTF-8 strings? Not that I'd find such a requirement particularly necessary (might be handy for all-ASCII strings, but easy to flat those cases), but how is it done? I can figure O(log(n)) ways with up to O(n) storage overhead or O(sqrt(n)) with up to O(sqrt(n)) storage overhead, but O(1) w/o the O(n) storage overhead of having UTF-32 around?</p></body></html>

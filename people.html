<h1>Armin Rigo</h1>
<img alt="image/people/arigo.png" src="image/people/arigo.png" />
<p>Armin Rigo is a former researcher at the Heinrich-Heine Universitat
Düsseldorf (Germany).  He studied Mathematics at the University
of Lausanne (Switzerland), obtained his Ph.D. in Logic and Set
Theory at the Free University of Brussels (Belgium) in 2002, and
worked at the University of Southampton (UK) until 2005.  He is
the author of Psyco, the first just-in-time compiler for Python.
He is one of the founders and lead developers of the PyPy project
which began in 2003.  He has taken part in all areas, from the Python
language definition to the RPython translation framework,
including the garbage collector and the tracing just-in-time
compiler.</p>

<div class="section" id="maciej-fijalkowski">
<h1>Maciej Fijałkowski</h1>
<img alt="image/people/fijal_thumb.png" src="image/people/fijal_thumb.png" />
<p>Maciej is a freelancer working mostly on PyPy for the past several years.
He's a core developer since 2006, working on all kinds of parts in
the entire codebase including JIT, GC and assembler backends.
Maciej has been going to many conferences, advertising PyPy to a broader
audience for the past several years, including a keynote at Pycon 2010.
He's also the main maintainer of
<a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/jitviewer">jitviewer</a>, a tool for analyzing performance of your python programs under
PyPy.</p>

<div class="section" id="carl-friedrich-bolz">
<h1>Carl Friedrich Bolz</h1>
<img alt="image/people/cfbolz.jpg" src="image/people/cfbolz.jpg" />
<p>Carl Friedrich is a core developer since 2005, currently doing his PhD at the
Heinrich-Heine Universität Düsseldorf (Germany). He has worked on most aspects
of PyPy, from the core interpreter to the GC to the JIT. He has published
several papers about the inner workings of PyPy, presenting them at various
scientific conferences. Carl Friedrich is also interested in other dynamic
language implementation and was the original author of the Prolog
implementation.</p>
<p>Carl Friedrich likes science fiction novels and sometimes plays the bassoon.</p>

<div class="section" id="antonio-cuni">
<h1>Antonio Cuni</h1>
<img alt="image/people/antocuni.png" src="image/people/antocuni.png" />
<p>Antonio Cuni loves skiing, mountains and programming languages.  He studied
Computer Science at the University of Genova (Italy), and then at the same
university he obtained his Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2010, with a
dissertation about the PyPy CLI JIT backend.  He has been a core PyPy
developer since 2006, working in various areas including the &ldquo;object oriented
backends&rdquo; for the CLI and JVM, the RPython translation framework, the Python
interpreter and the JIT compiler generator.  Apart from PyPy, he is the author of
other popular tools such as <tt class="docutils literal">pdb++</tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="benjamin-peterson">
<h1>Benjamin Peterson</h1>
<p>Both a PyPy and CPython core developer, Benjamin knows way too much about the
nooks and cranies of the Python language. He is driven by a fascination with
interpreters and compilers of all shapes and sizes. Around the PyPy project, he
tries to be generally useful and has taken on major projects including rewriting
PyPy's Python compiler and porting PyPy to Python 2.7.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="alex-gaynor">
<h1>Alex Gaynor</h1>
<img alt="image/people/alex.jpg" src="image/people/alex.jpg" />
<p>Alex is software engineer living in Washington, DC. He's been a PyPy developer
since 2010, and has worked on many parts of the codebase, including the JIT
compiler's optimizers, the RPython translation toolchain, and the Python
interpreter. In addition to his work on PyPy, Alex is also the creator of
Topaz, a Ruby VM built on RPython and a core developer of Django (a Python web
framework) and CPython, as well as a retired member of the board of directors
of the Python Software Foundation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hakan-ardo">
<h1>Håkan Ardö</h1>
<img alt="image/people/hakanardo.jpg" src="image/people/hakanardo.jpg" />
<p>Håkan Ardö received his master of science degree in electrical
engineering from Lund University in 2002. He specialized in
VLSI-design and Image Processing. He worked as a software
engineer at Axis Communications 2002-2003 before doing his
PhD at the Centre for Mathematical Sciences of Lund University
2003-2009 in the Mathematical Imaging Group. His thesis work consisted
of designing image processing algorithms for traffic surveillance,
aiming for a system that automatically measures the safety of an
intersection or road segment. He is currently working part-time as a
postdoc at the Centre for Mathematical Sciences of Lund University
continuing this work and part-time as CTO with a spinoff company
Cognimatics. His contributions to PyPy started 2010 and consists of
the array module as well as work on the JIT compiler's trace optimizers.</p>

<div class="section" id="holger-krekel">
<h1>Holger Krekel</h1>
<img alt="image/people/holger1.jpg" src="image/people/holger1.jpg" />
<p>Holger Krekel is a founder of the PyPy project and has participated in
PyPy core developement for several years as well as maintained much of
its infrastructure.  He also is the author of the popular <a class="reference external" href="http://pytest.org">py.test</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="http://codespeak.net/tox">tox</a> testing tools as well as <a class="reference external" href="http://codespeak.net/execnet">execnet</a>, a library for easily deploying
different interacting Python interpreters side by side.  He helped
manage multiple PyPy funding contracts through his company merlinux and is a
PyPy representative within the Software Freedom Conservancy (SFC).  He
holds a summa cum laude degree in computer science with a thesis about
artificial intelligence applied to the game of Go.  As of 2011 he is on
another sabbatical-ish leave, caring for his newborn son, travelling
and pondering what comes next.  Other than that he continues to care
for testing and some PyPy co-ordination bits behind the scene.</p>

<div class="section" id="samuele-pedroni">
<h1>Samuele Pedroni</h1>
<p>Samuele Pedroni got involved with PyPy almost at its inception in the
spring of 2003. One of the design contributors to PyPy, his help has
ranged from infrastructure and processes, through building out
RPython&#8230; optimizing the Python interpreter, to compressing resume
data in the last incarnation of the JIT compiler. Tempted away into the
application side of the software equation, these days he contributes
some words and wisdom to PyPy's paper writing.</p>

pypy.org webpages
==================

This is the repository of the pypy.org webpages.

The webpages are generated from the corresponding 
reStructuredText files in the `pages` directory 
using the static site generator *nikola* (https://getnikola.com/).

To change content of the pages, please change the 
files in the `files` directory only. 

!! The content of public is not written by hand, 
   **please do not modify** - it will be overwritten !!



Remark:
The site is pulled into pypy.org by a cron job on a psf-hosted instance,
see https://github.com/python/psf-salt/tree/master/salt/pypy-web and then 
converted to static html. 

The people with access to the instance are the ones in
https://github.com/python/psf-salt/blob/master/pillar/base/users.sls
with pypy-web access
